## Core React

This section covers fundamental **React JS interview questions** about React basics, including JSX, components, props, state, and the Virtual DOM. These are essential concepts that every React developer should master.

1.  ### What is React?

    <strong>React</strong> (also known as <strong>React.js</strong> or <strong>ReactJS</strong>) is an **open-source front-end JavaScript library** for building user interfaces based on components. It's used for handling the view layer in web and mobile applications, and allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of those components efficiently.

    **Key facts about React:**
    - <strong>Created by:</strong> Facebook (Meta)
    - <strong>First released:</strong> 2013
    - <strong>Current version:</strong> React 18+
    - <strong>License:</strong> MIT
    - <strong>Primary use case:</strong> Building interactive user interfaces

    React was created by [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke), a software engineer at Facebook (now Meta). It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012. The library was open-sourced in May 2013 and has since become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building modern user interfaces.

   2.  ### What is the history behind React evolution?
       The history of ReactJS started in 2010 with the creation of **XHP**. XHP is a PHP extension which improved the syntax of the language such that XML document fragments become valid PHP expressions and the primary purpose was used to create custom and reusable HTML elements.

       The main principle of this extension was to make front-end code easier to understand and to help avoid cross-site scripting attacks. The project was successful to prevent the malicious content submitted by the scrubbing user.

       But there was a different problem with XHP in which dynamic web applications require many roundtrips to the server, and XHP did not solve this problem. Also, the whole UI was re-rendered for small change in the application. Later, the initial prototype of React is created with the name **FaxJ** by Jordan inspired from XHP. Finally after sometime React has been introduced as a new library into JavaScript world.

       <div>

       <details>
       <summary><b>See deep-dive answer</b></summary>

       The evolution of React has a fascinating history that spans over a decade:

       **2010-2011: The Origins**
       - The journey began with **XHP**, a PHP extension created at Facebook that allowed HTML components to be used in PHP code
       - XHP improved front-end code readability and helped prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
       - However, XHP had limitations with dynamic web applications, requiring frequent server roundtrips and complete UI re-renders for small changes

       **2011-2012: Early Development**
       - Jordan Walke created the first prototype called **FaxJS** (later renamed to React), inspired by XHP's component model
       - The key innovation was bringing XHP's component model to JavaScript with performance improvements
       - React introduced the Virtual DOM concept to solve the performance issues of full page re-renders
       - First deployed internally on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and Instagram in 2012

       **2013: Public Release**
       - React was officially open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013
       - Initial public reception was mixed, with some developers skeptical about the JSX syntax and the approach of mixing markup with JavaScript

       **2014-2015: Growing Adoption**
       - React Native was announced in 2015, extending React's paradigm to mobile app development
       - The ecosystem began to grow with tools like Redux for state management
       - Companies beyond Facebook began adopting React for production applications

       **2016-2018: Maturation**
       - React 16 ("Fiber") was released in 2017 with a complete rewrite of the core architecture
       - Introduction of new features like Error Boundaries, Portals, and improved server-side rendering
       - React 16.3 introduced the Context API for easier state management

       **2019-Present: Modern React**
       - React Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 (February 2019), revolutionizing state management in functional components
       - React 17 (October 2020) focused on making React upgrades easier
       - React 18 (March 2022) introduced concurrent rendering and automatic batching
       - React continues to evolve with Server Components, the new React compiler (React Forget), and other performance improvements
       </details>

       </div>

       **Note:** JSX, React's syntax extension, was indeed inspired by XHP's approach of embedding XML-like syntax in code.

2.  ### What are the major features of React?

    React offers a powerful set of features that have made it one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces:

    **Core Features:**

    - **Component-Based Architecture**: React applications are built using components - independent, reusable pieces of code that return HTML via a render function. This modular approach enables better code organization, reusability, and maintenance.

    - **Virtual DOM**: React creates an in-memory data structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and efficiently updates only the changed parts in the browser DOM. This approach significantly improves performance compared to direct DOM manipulation.

    - **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: A syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript. JSX makes the code more readable and expressive while providing the full power of JavaScript.

    - **Unidirectional Data Flow**: React follows a one-way data binding model where data flows from parent to child components. This makes the code more predictable and easier to debug.

    - **Declarative UI**: React allows you to describe what your UI should look like for a given state, and it handles the DOM updates when the underlying data changes.

    **Advanced Features:**

    - **React Hooks**: Introduced in React 16.8, hooks allow using state and other React features in functional components without writing classes.

    - **Context API**: Provides a way to share values between components without explicitly passing props through every level of the component tree.

    - **Error Boundaries**: Components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree and display fallback UI instead of crashing.

    - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Enables rendering React components on the server before sending HTML to the client, improving performance and SEO.

    - **Concurrent Mode**: A set of new features (in development) that help React apps stay responsive and gracefully adjust to the user's device capabilities and network speed.

    - **React Server Components**: A new feature that allows components to be rendered entirely on the server, reducing bundle size and improving performance.

    - **Suspense**: A feature that lets your components "wait" for something before rendering, supporting code-splitting and data fetching with cleaner code.

    These features collectively make React powerful for building everything from small widgets to complex, large-scale web applications.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

3.  ### What is JSX?

    _JSX_ stands for _JavaScript XML_ and it is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript. Basically it just provides the syntactic sugar for the `React.createElement(type, props, ...children)` function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.

    In the example below, the text inside `<h1>` tag is returned as JavaScript function to the render function.

    ```jsx harmony
    export default function App() {
      return <h1 className="greeting">{"Hello, this is a JSX Code!"}</h1>;
    }
    ```

    If you don't use JSX syntax then the respective JavaScript code should be written as below,

    ```javascript
    import { createElement } from "react";

    export default function App() {
      return createElement(
        "h1",
        { className: "greeting" },
        "Hello, this is a JSX Code!"
      );
    }
    ```

<div>

<details>
<summary><b>See Class</b></summary>

```jsx harmony
    class App extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <h1 className="greeting">{"Hello, this is a JSX Code!"}</h1>;
      }
    }
```
</details>

</div>

    **Note:** JSX is stricter than HTML

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

4.  ### What is the difference between an Element and a Component?

      **Element:**
      - A React **Element** is a plain JavaScript object that describes what you want to see on the UI. It represents a DOM node or a component at a specific point in time.
      - Elements are immutable: once created, you cannot change their properties. Instead, you create new elements to reflect updates.
      - Elements can be nested within other elements through their `props`.
      - Creating an element is a fast, lightweight operation—it does **not** create any actual DOM nodes or render anything to the screen directly.

        **Example (without JSX):**
        ```js
        const element = React.createElement("button", { id: "login-btn" }, "Login");
        ```

        **Equivalent JSX syntax:**
        ```jsx
        <button id="login-btn">Login</button>
        ```

        **The object returned by `React.createElement`:**
        ```js
        {
          type: 'button',
          props: {
            id: 'login-btn',
            children: 'Login'
          }
        }
        ```
        Elements are then passed to the React DOM renderer (e.g., `ReactDOM.render()`), which translates them to actual DOM nodes.

        ---

      **Component:**
      - A **Component** is a function or class that returns an element (or a tree of elements) to describe part of the UI. Components can accept inputs (called **props**) and manage their own state (in case of class or function components with hooks).
      - Components allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, each isolated and composable.
      - You can define a component using a function or a class:

        **Example (Function Component with JSX):**
        ```jsx
        const Button = ({ handleLogin }) => (
          <button id="login-btn" onClick={handleLogin}>
            Login
          </button>
        );
        ```

        When JSX is compiled, it's transformed into a tree of `React.createElement` calls:

        ```js
        const Button = ({ handleLogin }) =>
          React.createElement(
            "button",
            { id: "login-btn", onClick: handleLogin },
            "Login"
          );
        ```

        ---

      **In summary:**
      - **Elements** are the smallest building blocks in React—objects that describe what you want to see.
      - **Components** are functions or classes that return elements and encapsulate logic, structure, and behavior for parts of your UI.

       > Think of **elements** as the instructions for creating UI, and **components** as reusable blueprints that combine logic and structure to generate those instructions.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

5.  ### How to create components in React?

    Components are the building blocks of creating User Interfaces(UI) in React. There are two possible ways to create a component.

    1. **Function Components:** This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as the one and only one parameter and return React elements to render the output:

       ```jsx harmony
       function Greeting({ message }) {
         return <h1>{`Hello, ${message}`}</h1>;
       }
       ```

    2. **Class Components:** You can also use ES6 class to define a component. The above function component can be written as a class component:

       ```jsx harmony
       class Greeting extends React.Component {
         render() {
           return <h1>{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}</h1>;
         }
       }
       ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

6.  ### When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?

    After the addition of Hooks(i.e. React 16.8 onwards) it is always recommended to use Function components over Class components in React. Because you could use state, lifecycle methods and other features that were only available in class component present in function component too.

    But even there are two reasons to use Class components over Function components.

    1. If you need a React functionality whose Function component equivalent is not present yet, like Error Boundaries.
    2. In older versions, If the component needs _state or lifecycle methods_ then you need to use class component.

    So the summary to this question is as follows:

    **Use Function Components:**

    - If you don't need state or lifecycle methods, and your component is purely presentational.
    - For simplicity, readability, and modern code practices, especially with the use of React Hooks for state and side effects.

    **Use Class Components:**

    - If you need to manage state or use lifecycle methods.
    - In scenarios where backward compatibility or integration with older code is necessary.

    **Note:** You can also use reusable [react error boundary](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) third-party component without writing any class. i.e, No need to use class components for Error boundaries.

    The usage of Error boundaries from the above library is quite straight forward.

    > **_Note when using react-error-boundary:_** ErrorBoundary is a client component. You can only pass props to it that are serializable or use it in files that have a `"use client";` directive.

    ```jsx
    "use client";

    import { ErrorBoundary } from "react-error-boundary";

    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>Something went wrong</div>}>
      <ExampleApplication />
    </ErrorBoundary>;
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

7.  ### What are Pure Components?

    Pure components are the components which render the same output for the same state and props. In function components, you can achieve these pure components through memoized `React.memo()` API wrapping around the component. This API prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing the previous props and new props using shallow comparison. So it will be helpful for performance optimizations.

    But at the same time, it won't compare the previous state with the current state because function component itself prevents the unnecessary rendering by default when you set the same state again.

    The syntactic representation of memoized components looks like below,

    ```jsx
    const MemoizedComponent = memo(SomeComponent, arePropsEqual?);
    ```

    Below is the example of how child component(i.e., EmployeeProfile) prevents re-renders for the same props passed by parent component(i.e.,EmployeeRegForm).

    ```jsx
    import { memo, useState } from "react";

    const EmployeeProfile = memo(function EmployeeProfile({ name, email }) {
      return (
        <>
          <p>Name:{name}</p>
          <p>Email: {email}</p>
        </>
      );
    });
    export default function EmployeeRegForm() {
      const [name, setName] = useState("");
      const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
      return (
        <>
          <label>
            Name:{" "}
            <input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
          </label>
          <label>
            Email:{" "}
            <input value={email} onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)} />
          </label>
          <hr />
          <EmployeeProfile name={name} />
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

    In the above code, the email prop has not been passed to child component. So there won't be any re-renders for email prop change.

    In class components, the components extending _`React.PureComponent`_ instead of _`React.Component`_ become the pure components. When props or state changes, _PureComponent_ will do a shallow comparison on both props and state by invoking `shouldComponentUpdate()` lifecycle method.

    **Note:** `React.memo()` is a higher-order component.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

8.  ### What is state in React?

    _State_ of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. The important point is whenever the state object changes, the component re-renders. It is always recommended to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.

    ![state](https://github.com/sudheerj/reactjs-interview-questions/blob/master/images/state.jpg)

    Let's take an example of **User** component with `message` state. Here, **useState** hook has been used to add state to the User component and it returns an array with current state and function to update it.

    ```jsx harmony
    import { useState } from "react";

    function User() {
      const [message, setMessage] = useState("Welcome to React world");

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>{message}</h1>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    Whenever React calls your component or access `useState` hook, it gives you a snapshot of the state for that particular render.

<div>

<details>
<summary><b>See Class</b></summary>

    ```jsx harmony
    import React from "react";
    class User extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
          message: "Welcome to React world",
        };
      }

      render() {
        return (
          <div>
            <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
          </div>
        );
      }
    }
    ```
</details>

</div>

    State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component ,i.e., it is not accessible to any other component till the owner component decides to pass it.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

9.  ### What are props in React?

    _Props_ are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation similar to HTML-tag attributes. Here, the data is passed down from a parent component to a child component.

    The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:

    1. Pass custom data to your component.
    2. Trigger state changes.
    3. Use via `this.props.reactProp` inside component's `render()` method.

    For example, let us create an element with `reactProp` property:

    ```jsx harmony
    <Element reactProp={"1"} />
    ```

    This `reactProp` (or whatever you came up with) attribute name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.

    ```jsx harmony
    props.reactProp;
    ```

    For example, the usage of props in function component looks like below:

    ```jsx
    import React from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

    const ChildComponent = (props) => {
      return (
        <div>
          <p>{props.name}</p>
          <p>{props.age}</p>
          <p>{props.gender}</p>
        </div>
      );
    };

    const ParentComponent = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          <ChildComponent name="John" age="30" gender="male" />
          <ChildComponent name="Mary" age="25" geneder="female" />
        </div>
      );
    };
    ```

The properties from props object can be accessed directly using destructing feature from ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). It is also possible to fallback to default value when the prop value is not specified. The above child component can be simplified like below.

```jsx harmony
const ChildComponent = ({ name, age, gender = "male" }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{name}</p>
      <p>{age}</p>
      <p>{gender}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Note:** The default value won't be used if you pass `null` or `0` value. i.e, default value is only used if the prop value is missed or `undefined` value has been passed.

<div>

<details>
<summary><b>See Class</b></summary>
<p>The Props accessed in Class Based Component as below</p>

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

class ChildComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{this.props.name}</p>
        <p>{this.props.age}</p>
        <p>{this.props.gender}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <ChildComponent name="John" age="30" gender="male" />
        <ChildComponent name="Mary" age="25" gender="female" />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

</details>

</div>

10.  ### What is the difference between state and props?

    In React, both **state** and **props** are plain JavaScript objects, but they serve different purposes and have distinct behaviors:

    ### State
    - **Definition:**
      State is a data structure that is managed within a component. It represents information that can change over the lifetime of the component.
    - **Mutability:**
      State is mutable, meaning it can be changed using the setter function (`setState` in class components or the updater function from `useState` in functional components).
    - **Scope:**
      State is local to the component where it is defined. Only that component can modify its own state.
    - **Usage:**
      State is typically used for data that needs to change in response to user actions, network responses, or other dynamic events.
    - **Re-rendering:**
      Updating the state triggers a re-render of the component and its descendants.

    ### Props
    - **Definition:**
      Props (short for “properties”) are inputs to a component, provided by its parent component.
    - **Mutability:**
      Props are read-only. A component cannot modify its own props; they are immutable from the component’s perspective.
    - **Scope:**
      Props are used to pass data and event handlers down the component tree, enabling parent components to configure or communicate with their children.
    - **Usage:**
      Props are commonly used to make components reusable and configurable. They allow the same component to be rendered with different data or behavior.
    - **Analogy:**
      Think of props as arguments to a function, whereas state is like variables declared inside the function.

    ### Summary Table

    | Feature   | State                               | Props                             |

11.  ### What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?

    Below are some of the main differences between HTML and React event handling,

    1. In HTML, the event name usually represents in _lowercase_ as a convention:

       ```html
       <button onclick="activateLasers()"></button>
       ```

       Whereas in React it follows _camelCase_ convention:

       ```jsx harmony
       <button onClick={activateLasers}>
       ```

    2. In HTML, you can return `false` to prevent default behavior:

       ```html
       <a
         href="#"
         onclick='console.log("The link was clicked."); return false;'
       />
       ```

       Whereas in React you must call `preventDefault()` explicitly:

       ```javascript
       function handleClick(event) {
         event.preventDefault();
         console.log("The link was clicked.");
       }
       ```

    3. In HTML, you need to invoke the function by appending `()`
       Whereas in react you should not append `()` with the function name. (refer "activateLasers" function in the first point for example)

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

12.  ### What are synthetic events in React?

    `SyntheticEvent` is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event. Its API is same as the browser's native event, including `stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()`, except the events work identically across all browsers. The native events can be accessed directly from synthetic events using `nativeEvent` attribute.

    Let's take an example of `BookStore` title search component with the ability to get all native event properties

    ```js
    function BookStore() {
      function handleTitleChange(e) {
        console.log("The new title is:", e.target.value);
        console.log('Synthetic event:', e); // React SyntheticEvent
        console.log('Native event:', e.nativeEvent); // Browser native event
        e.stopPropagation();
        e.preventDefault();
      }

      return <input name="title" onChange={handleTitleChange} />;
    }
    ```

    List of common synthetic events are:

    *   `onClick`
    *   `onChange`
    *   `onSubmit`
    *   `onKeyDown`, `onKeyUp`
    *   `onFocus`, `onBlur`
    *   `onMouseEnter`, `onMouseLeave`
    *   `onTouchStart`, `onTouchEnd`

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

13.  ### What are inline conditional expressions?

    You can use either _if statements_ or _ternary expressions_ which are available in JS(and JSX in React) to conditionally execute or render expressions. Apart from these approaches, you can also embed any expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces and then followed by JS logical operator `&&`. It is helpful to render elements conditionally within a single line and commonly used for concise logic, especially in JSX rendering.

    ```jsx harmony
    <h1>Hello!</h1>;
    {
      messages.length > 0 && !isLogin ? (
        <h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.</h2>
      ) : (
        <h2>You don't have unread messages.</h2>
      );
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

14.  ### What is "key" prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of elements?

    A `key` is a special attribute you **should** include when mapping over arrays to render data. _Key_ prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

    Keys should be unique among its siblings. Most often we use ID from our data as _key_:

    ```jsx harmony
    const todoItems = todos.map((todo) => <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>);
    ```

    When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item _index_ as a _key_ as a last resort:

    ```jsx harmony
    const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) => (
      <li key={index}>{todo.text}</li>
    ));
    ```
    **Benefits of key:**
      *   Enables React to **efficiently update and re-render** components.
      *   Prevents unnecessary re-renders by **reusing** components when possible.
      *   Helps **maintain internal state** of list items correctly.

    **Note:**

    1. Using _indexes_ for _keys_ is **not recommended** if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.
    2. If you extract list item as separate component then apply _keys_ on list component instead of `li` tag.
    3. There will be a warning message in the console if the `key` prop is not present on list items.
    4. The key attribute accepts either string or number and internally convert it as string type.
    5. Don't generate the key on the fly something like `key={Math.random()}`. Because the keys will never match up between re-renders and DOM created everytime.

15.  ### What is Virtual DOM?

    The _Virtual DOM_ (VDOM) is a lightweight, in-memory representation of _Real DOM_ used by libraries like React to optimize UI rendering. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM. It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called _reconciliation_.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

16.  ### How Virtual DOM works?

    The _Virtual DOM_ works in five simple steps.

    **1. Initial Render**
        When a UI component renders for the first time, it returns JSX. React uses this structure to create a Virtual DOM tree, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. This Virtual DOM is then used to build and render the Real DOM in the browser.

    **2. State or Props Change**
        When the component's state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM reflecting the updated UI. However, it doesn't immediately update the Real DOM; instead, it works in memory to prepare for an efficient update.

      ![vdom](images/vdom1.png)

    **3. Diffing Algorithm**
        React then compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one using a process called diffing. It determines what has changed between the two versions and identifies the minimal set of updates needed.

       ![vdom2](images/vdom2.png)

    **4. Reconciliation**
        Based on the diffing results, React decides which parts of the Real DOM should be updated. It avoids re-rendering the entire DOM and instead updates only the elements that actually changed.

       ![vdom3](images/vdom3.png)

    **5. Efficient DOM Updates**
        This entire process—working with the Virtual DOM, diffing, and selective updating—makes the UI rendering much faster and more efficient than manipulating the Real DOM directly.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

17.  ### What is the difference between Shadow DOM and Virtual DOM?

    The _Shadow DOM_ is a browser technology designed primarily for scoping variables and CSS in _web components_. The _Virtual DOM_ is a concept implemented by libraries in JavaScript on top of browser APIs.

    The key differences in a table format shown below:

    | Feature | Shadow DOM | Virtual DOM |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Purpose | Encapsulation for Web Components | Efficient UI rendering |
    | Managed by | Browser | JS frameworks (e.g., React) |
    | DOM Type | Part of real DOM (scoped) | In-memory representation |
    | Encapsulation | Yes | No |
    | Use Case | Web Components, scoped styling | UI diffing and minimal DOM updates |

18.  ### What is React Fiber?

    **React Fiber** is the **new reconciliation engine** in React, introduced in React 16. It’s a complete rewrite of React’s core algorithm(old stack-based algorithm) for rendering and updating the UI. Fiber enhances React’s ability to handle **asynchronous rendering**, **prioritized updates**(assign priority to different types of updates), and **interruption**(ability to pause, abort, or reuse work) of rendering work, enabling smoother and more responsive user interfaces.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

19.  ### What is the main goal of React Fiber?

    The goal of _React Fiber_ is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline feature is **incremental rendering**: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

    Its main goals are:

    *   **Incremental Rendering** – Breaks work into chunks for smoother updates.
    *   **Interruptible Rendering** – Pauses and resumes rendering to keep the UI responsive.
    *   **Prioritization** – Handles high-priority updates (e.g. animations) before low-priority ones.
    *   **Concurrency Support** – Enables working on multiple UI versions simultaneously.
    *   **Better Error Handling** – Supports component-level error boundaries.
    *   **Suspense Support** – Allows waiting for async data before rendering.
    *   **Improved DevTools** – Enables better debugging and performance tracking.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

20.  ### What are controlled components?

    A **controlled component** is a React component that **fully manages the form element's state**(e.g, elements like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, or `<select>`))  using React's internal state mechanism. i.e, The component does not manage its own internal state — instead, React acts as the single source of truth for form data.

    The controlled components will be implemented using the below steps,

    1. Initialize the state using `useState` hooks in function components or inside constructor for class components.
    2. Set the value of the form element to the respective state variable.
    3. Create an event handler(`onChange`) to handle the user input changes through `useState`'s updater function or `setState` from class component.
    4. Attach the above event handler to form element's change or click events

    **Note:** React re-renders the component every time the input value changes.

   For example, the name input field updates the username using `handleChange` event handler as below,

   ```javascript
   import React, { useState } from "react";

   function UserProfile() {
     const [username, setUsername] = useState("");

     const handleChange = (e) => {
       setUsername(e.target.value);
     };

     return (
       <form>
         <label>
           Name:
           <input type="text" value={username} onChange={handleChange} />
         </label>
       </form>
     );
   }
   ```
   In these components, DOM does not hold the actual data instead React does.

   **Benefits:**

   *   Easy to implement **validation**, **conditional formatting**, or **live feedback**.
   *   Full control over form data.
   *   Easier to test and debug because the data is centralized in the component’s state.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

21.  ### What are uncontrolled components?
    The **Uncontrolled components** are form elements (like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, or `<select>`) that **manage their own state internally** via the **DOM**, rather than through React state.
    You can query the DOM using a `ref` to find its current value when you need it. This is a bit more like traditional HTML.

    The uncontrolled components will be implemented using the below steps,

    1. Create a ref using `useRef` react hook in function component or `React.createRef()` in class based component.
    2. Attach this `ref` to the form element.
    3. The form element value can be accessed directly through `ref` in event handlers or `componentDidMount` for class components

    In the below UserProfile component, the `username` input is accessed using ref.

    ```jsx harmony
    import React, { useRef } from "react";

    function UserProfile() {
      const usernameRef = useRef(null);

      const handleSubmit = (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        console.log("The submitted username is: " + usernameRef.current.value);
      };

      return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
          <label>
            Username:
            <input type="text" ref={usernameRef} />
          </label>
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
      );
    }
    ```
    **Note:** Here, DOM is in charge of the value. React only accesses the value when needed (via `ref`).

    **Benefits:**
     *   **Less boilerplate** — no need for `useState` and `onChange`.
     *   Useful for **quick form setups** or when integrating with **non-React code**.
     *   Slightly better **performance** in very large forms (fewer re-renders).

    In most cases, it's recommend to use controlled components to implement forms. In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself.

      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
        this.input = React.createRef();
      }

      handleSubmit(event) {
        alert("A name was submitted: " + this.input.current.value);
        event.preventDefault();
      }

      render() {
        return (
          <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
            <label>
              {"Name:"}
              <input type="text" ref={this.input} />
            </label>
            <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
          </form>
        );
      }
    }

22.  ### What is the difference between createElement and cloneElement?
    Both `React.createElement` and `React.cloneElement` are used to work with React elements, but they serve different purposes.

    #### **createElement:**
    Creates a new React element from scratch. JSX elements will be transpiled to `React.createElement()` functions to create React elements which are going to be used for the object representation of UI.
    **Syntax:**
    ```jsx
    React.createElement(type, props, ...children)
    ```
    **Example:**
    ```jsx
    React.createElement('button', { className: 'btn' }, 'Click Me')
    ```
    #### **cloneElement:**
     The `cloneElement` method is used to clone an existing React element and optionally adds or overrides props.

    **Syntax:**
    ```jsx
    React.cloneElement(element, newProps, ...children)
    ```
    **Example:**
    ```jsx
    const button = <button className="btn">Click Me</button>;
    const cloned = React.cloneElement(button, { className: 'btn-primary' });
    // Result: <button className="btn-primary">Click Me</button>
    ```

23.  ### What is Lifting State Up in React?

    When several components need to share the same changing data then it is recommended to _lift the shared state up_ to their closest common ancestor. That means if two child components share the same data from its parent, then move the state to parent instead of maintaining local state in both of the child components.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

24.  ### What are Higher-Order Components?

    A _higher-order component_ (_HOC_) is a function that takes a component and returns a new enhanced component with additional props, behavior, or data. It’s a design pattern based on React’s compositional nature, allowing you to reuse logic across multiple components without modifying their internals.

    We consider HOCs **pure components** because they don’t mutate or copy behavior from the original component—they simply **wrap it**, enhance it, and pass through the necessary props. The wrapped component remains decoupled and reusable.

    ```javascript
    const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
    ```
    Let's take an example of a `withAuth` higher-order component (HOC) in React. This HOC will check if a user is authenticated and either render the wrapped component if authenticated or redirect (or show a message) if not.

    **withAuth HOC Example:**
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom'; // For redirection (assuming React Router v6)

    const isAuthenticated = () => {
      // e.g., check for a valid token in localStorage or context
      return !!localStorage.getItem('authToken');
    };

    function withAuth(WrappedComponent) {
      return function AuthenticatedComponent(props) {
        if (!isAuthenticated()) {
          // User is NOT authenticated, redirect to login page
          return <Navigate to="/login" replace />;
        }

        // User is authenticated, render the wrapped component
        return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
      };
    }

    export default withAuth;
    ```
    **Usage**
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import withAuth from './withAuth';

    function Dashboard() {
      return <h1>Welcome to the Dashboard!</h1>;
    }

    // Wrap Dashboard with withAuth HOC
    export default withAuth(Dashboard);
    ```

    HOC can be used for many use cases:

    1. Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction (e.g., fetching data, permissions, theming).
    2. Render hijacking (e.g., conditional rendering or layout changes).
    3. State abstraction and manipulation(e.g., handling form logic).
    4. Props manipulation(e.g., injecting additional props or filtering them).

    Some of the real-world examples of HOCs in react eco-system:
    1. connect() from react-redux
    2. withRouter() from React Router v5
    3. withTranslation() from react-i18next
    4. withApollo() from Apollo client
    5. withFormik from Formik library
    6. withTheme from styled components

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

25.  ### What is children prop?
    The `children` prop is a special prop in React used to pass elements between the opening and closing tags of a component. It is commonly used in layout and wrapper componnents.

    A simple usage of children prop looks as below,

    ```jsx harmony
    function MyDiv({ children }){
        return (
          <div>
            {children}
          </div>;
        );
    }

    export default function Greeting() {
      return (
        <MyDiv>
          <span>{"Hello"}</span>
          <span>{"World"}</span>
        </MyDiv>
      );
    }
    ```
    Here, everything inside `<MyDiv>...</MyDiv>` is passed as children to the custom div component.

    The children can be text, JSX elements, fragments, arrays and functions(for advance use case like render props).

<div>

<details>
<summary><b>See Class</b></summary>

    ```jsx harmony
    const MyDiv = React.createClass({
      render: function () {
        return <div>{this.props.children}</div>;
      },
    });

    ReactDOM.render(
      <MyDiv>
        <span>{"Hello"}</span>
        <span>{"World"}</span>
      </MyDiv>,
      node
    );
    ```
</details>

</div>

    **Note:** There are several methods available in the legacy React API to work with this prop. These include `React.Children.map`, `React.Children.forEach`, `React.Children.count`, `React.Children.only`, `React.Children.toArray`.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

26.  ### What is reconciliation?

    `Reconciliation` is the process through which React updates the Browser DOM and makes React work faster. React use a `diffing algorithm` so that component updates are predictable and faster. React would first calculate the difference between the `real DOM` and the copy of DOM `(Virtual DOM)` when there's an update of components.
    React stores a copy of Browser DOM which is called `Virtual DOM`. When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one. This comparison is done by `Diffing Algorithm`.
    Now React compares the Virtual DOM with Real DOM. It finds out the changed nodes and updates only the changed nodes in Real DOM leaving the rest nodes as it is. This process is called _Reconciliation_.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

27.  ### Does the lazy function support named exports?

    No, currently `React.lazy` function supports default exports only. If you would like to import modules which are named exports, you can create an intermediate module that reexports it as the default. It also ensures that tree shaking keeps working and don’t pull unused components.
    Let's take a component file which exports multiple named components,

    ```javascript
    // MoreComponents.js
    export const SomeComponent = /* ... */;
    export const UnusedComponent = /* ... */;
    ```

    and reexport `MoreComponents.js` components in an intermediate file `IntermediateComponent.js`

    ```javascript
    // IntermediateComponent.js
    export { SomeComponent as default } from "./MoreComponents.js";
    ```

    Now you can import the module using lazy function as below,

    ```javascript
    import React, { lazy } from "react";
    const SomeComponent = lazy(() => import("./IntermediateComponent.js"));
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

28.  ### Why React uses `className` over `class` attribute?

    React uses **className** instead of **class** because of a JavaScript naming conflict with the class keyword.

    1. `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript
        In JavaScript, class is used to define ES6 classes:

        ```js
        class Person {
          constructor(name) {
            this.name = name;
          }
        }
        ```
        If you try to use class as a variable or property name, it will throw a syntax error. Since JSX is just JavaScript with XML-like syntax, using class directly in JSX would break the parser.

    2. JSX Is JavaScript

        When you write JSX like this:
        ```jsx
        <div class="btn">Click</div>
        ```
        It will be compiled to:
        ```jsx
        React.createElement('div', { class: 'btn' }, 'Click');
        ```
        But `class` is invalid in this object literal context (since it clashes with the JS keyword), hence React instead uses className.
        ```jsx
        <div className="btn">Click</div>
        ```
        which compiles to:
        ```jsx
        React.createElement('div', { className: 'btn' }, 'Click');
        ```
        React then translates `className` to` class` in the final HTML DOM.

    3. Aligns with DOM APIs
        In vanilla JavaScript, you interact with element classes using:
        ```js
        element.className = 'my-class';
        ```
        React follows this convention, staying consistent with the DOM API's property name rather than HTML’s attribute.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

29.  ### What are fragments?

    It's a common pattern or practice in React for a component to return multiple elements. _Fragments_ let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
    You need to use either `<Fragment>` or a shorter syntax having empty tag (`<></>`).

    Below is the example of how to use fragment inside _Story_ component.

    ```jsx harmony
    function Story({ title, description, date }) {
      return (
        <Fragment>
          <h2>{title}</h2>
          <p>{description}</p>
          <p>{date}</p>
        </Fragment>
      );
    }
    ```

    It is also possible to render list of fragments inside a loop with the mandatory **key** attribute supplied.

    ```jsx harmony
    function StoryBook() {
      return stories.map((story) => (
        <Fragment key={story.id}>
          <h2>{story.title}</h2>
          <p>{story.description}</p>
          <p>{story.date}</p>
        </Fragment>
      ));
    }
    ```

    Usually, you don't need to use `<Fragment>` until there is a need of _key_ attribute. The usage of shorter syntax looks like below.

    ```jsx harmony
    function Story({ title, description, date }) {
      return (
        <>
          <h2>{title}</h2>
          <p>{description}</p>
          <p>{date}</p>
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

30.  ### Why fragments are better than container divs?

    Below are the list of reasons to prefer fragments over container DOM elements,

    1. Fragments are a bit faster and use less memory by not creating an extra DOM node. This only has a real benefit on very large and deep trees.
    2. Some CSS mechanisms like _Flexbox_ and _CSS Grid_ have a special parent-child relationships, and adding divs in the middle makes it hard to keep the desired layout.
    3. The DOM Inspector is less cluttered.

31.  ### What are portals in React?

    A Portal is a React feature that enables rendering children into a DOM node that exists outside the parent component's DOM hierarchy, while still preserving the React component hierarchy. Portals help avoid CSS stacking issues—for example, elements with position: fixed may not behave as expected inside a parent with transform. Portals solve this by rendering content (like modals or tooltips) outside such constrained DOM contexts.

    ```javascript
    ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container);
    ```
    *   `child`: Any valid React node (e.g., JSX, string, fragment).
    *   `container`: A real DOM node (e.g., `document.getElementById('modal-root')`).

    Even though the content renders elsewhere in the DOM, it still behaves like a normal child in React. It has access to context, state, and event handling.

    **Example:- Modal:**
    ```jsx
    function Modal({ children }) {
      return ReactDOM.createPortal(
        <div className="modal">{children}</div>,
        document.body)
      );
    }
    ```
    The above code will render the modal content into the body element in the HTML, not inside the component's usual location.

32.  ### What are stateless components?

    If the behaviour of a component is independent of its state then it can be a stateless component. You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components. But unless you need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, you should go for function components. There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use function components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, a little faster, and you can avoid the `this` keyword altogether.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

33.  ### What are stateful components?

    If the behaviour of a component is dependent on the _state_ of the component then it can be termed as stateful component. These _stateful components_ are either function components with hooks or _class components_.

    Let's take an example of function stateful component which update the state based on click event,

    ```javascript
    import React, {useState} from 'react';

    const App = (props) => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    handleIncrement() {
      setCount(count+1);
    }

    return (
      <>
        <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
        <span>Counter: {count}</span>
      </>
      )
    }
    ```

<div>

<details>
<summary><b>See Class</b></summary>
<p>The equivalent class stateful component with a state that gets initialized in the `constructor`.</p>

```jsx harmony
    class App extends Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { count: 0 };
      }

      handleIncrement() {
        setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
      }

      render() {
        <>
          <button onClick={() => this.handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
          <span>Count: {count}</span>
        </>;
      }
    }
    ```

</details>

</div>

34.  ### How to apply validation on props in React?

    When the application is running in _development mode_, React will automatically check all props that we set on components to make sure they have _correct type_. If the type is incorrect, React will generate warning messages in the console. It's disabled in _production mode_ due to performance impact. The mandatory props are defined with `isRequired`.

    The set of predefined prop types:

    1. `PropTypes.number`
    2. `PropTypes.string`
    3. `PropTypes.array`
    4. `PropTypes.object`
    5. `PropTypes.func`
    6. `PropTypes.node`
    7. `PropTypes.element`
    8. `PropTypes.bool`
    9. `PropTypes.symbol`
    10. `PropTypes.any`

    We can define `propTypes` for `User` component as below:

    ```jsx harmony
    import React from "react";
    import PropTypes from "prop-types";

    class User extends React.Component {
      static propTypes = {
        name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
        age: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
      };

      render() {
        return (
          <>
            <h1>{`Welcome, ${this.props.name}`}</h1>
            <h2>{`Age, ${this.props.age}`}</h2>
          </>
        );
      }
    }
    ```

    **Note:** In React v15.5 _PropTypes_ were moved from `React.PropTypes` to `prop-types` library.

    _The Equivalent Functional Component_

    ```jsx harmony
    import React from "react";
    import PropTypes from "prop-types";

    function User({ name, age }) {
      return (
        <>
          <h1>{`Welcome, ${name}`}</h1>
          <h2>{`Age, ${age}`}</h2>
        </>
      );
    }

    User.propTypes = {
      name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
      age: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
    };
    ```

35.  ### What are the advantages of React?

    Below are the list of main advantages of React,

    1. Increases the application's performance with _Virtual DOM_.
    2. JSX makes code easy to read and write.
    3. It renders both on client and server side (_SSR_).
    4. Easy to integrate with frameworks (Angular, Backbone) since it is only a view library.
    5. Easy to write unit and integration tests with tools such as Jest.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

36.  ### What are the limitations of React?

    Apart from the advantages, there are few limitations of React too,

    1. React is just a view library, not a full framework.
    2. There is a learning curve for beginners who are new to web development.
    3. Integrating React into a traditional MVC framework requires some additional configuration.
    4. The code complexity increases with inline templating and JSX.
    5. Too many smaller components leading to over engineering or boilerplate.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

37.  ### What are the recommended ways for static type checking?

    Normally we use _PropTypes library_ (`React.PropTypes` moved to a `prop-types` package since React v15.5) for _type checking_ in the React applications. For large code bases, it is recommended to use _static type checkers_ such as Flow or TypeScript, that perform type checking at compile time and provide auto-completion features.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

38.  ### What is the use of `react-dom` package?

    The `react-dom` package provides _DOM-specific methods_ that can be used at the top level of your app. Most of the components are not required to use this module. Some of the methods of this package are:

    1. `render()`
    2. `hydrate()`
    3. `unmountComponentAtNode()`
    4. `findDOMNode()`
    5. `createPortal()`

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

39.  ### What is ReactDOMServer?

    The `ReactDOMServer` object enables you to render components to static markup (typically used on node server). This object is mainly used for _server-side rendering_ (SSR). The following methods can be used in both the server and browser environments:

    1. `renderToString()`
    2. `renderToStaticMarkup()`

    For example, you generally run a Node-based web server like Express, Hapi, or Koa, and you call `renderToString` to render your root component to a string, which you then send as response.

    ```javascript
    // using Express
    import { renderToString } from "react-dom/server";
    import MyPage from "./MyPage";

    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
      res.write(
        "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>My Page</title></head><body>"
      );
      res.write('<div id="content">');
      res.write(renderToString(<MyPage />));
      res.write("</div></body></html>");
      res.end();
    });
    ```

40.  ### How to use innerHTML in React?

    The `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` attribute is React's replacement for using `innerHTML` in the browser DOM. Just like `innerHTML`, it is risky to use this attribute considering cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. You just need to pass a `__html` object as key and HTML text as value.

    In this example MyComponent uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` attribute for setting HTML markup:

    ```jsx harmony
    function createMarkup() {
      return { __html: "First &middot; Second" };
    }

    function MyComponent() {
      return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={createMarkup()} />;
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

41.  ### How to use styles in React?

    The `style` attribute accepts a JavaScript object with camelCased properties rather than a CSS string. This is consistent with the DOM style JavaScript property, is more efficient, and prevents XSS security holes.

    ```jsx harmony
    const divStyle = {
      color: "blue",
      backgroundImage: "url(" + imgUrl + ")",
    };

    function HelloWorldComponent() {
      return <div style={divStyle}>Hello World!</div>;
    }
    ```

    Style keys are camelCased in order to be consistent with accessing the properties on DOM nodes in JavaScript (e.g. `node.style.backgroundImage`).

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

42.  ### How events are different in React?

    Handling events in React elements has some syntactic differences:

    1. React event handlers are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
    2. With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

43.  ### What is the impact of indexes as keys?

    Keys should be stable, predictable, and unique so that React can keep track of elements.

    In the below code snippet each element's key will be based on ordering, rather than tied to the data that is being represented. This limits the optimizations that React can do and creates confusing bugs in the application.

    ```jsx harmony
    {
      todos.map((todo, index) => <Todo {...todo} key={index} />);
    }
    ```

    If you use element data for unique key, assuming `todo.id` is unique to this list and stable, React would be able to reorder elements without needing to reevaluate them as much.

    ```jsx harmony
    {
      todos.map((todo) => <Todo {...todo} key={todo.id} />);
    }
    ```

    **Note:** If you don't specify `key` prop at all, React will use index as a key's value while iterating over an array of data.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

44.  ### How do you conditionally render components?

    In some cases you want to render different components depending on some state. JSX does not render `false` or `undefined`, so you can use conditional _short-circuiting_ to render a given part of your component only if a certain condition is true.

    ```jsx harmony
    const MyComponent = ({ name, address }) => (
      <div>
        <h2>{name}</h2>
        {address && <p>{address}</p>}
      </div>
    );
    ```

    If you need an `if-else` condition then use _ternary operator_.

    ```jsx harmony
    const MyComponent = ({ name, address }) => (
      <div>
        <h2>{name}</h2>
        {address ? <p>{address}</p> : <p>{"Address is not available"}</p>}
      </div>
    );
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

45.  ### Why we need to be careful when spreading props on DOM elements?

    When we _spread props_ we run into the risk of adding unknown HTML attributes, which is a bad practice. Instead we can use prop destructuring with `...rest` operator, so it will add only required props.

    For example,

    ```jsx harmony
    const ComponentA = () => (
      <ComponentB isDisplay={true} className={"componentStyle"} />
    );

    const ComponentB = ({ isDisplay, ...domProps }) => (
      <div {...domProps}>{"ComponentB"}</div>
    );
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

46.  ### How do you memoize a component?

    There are memoize libraries available which can be used on function components.

    For example `moize` library can memoize the component in another component.

    ```jsx harmony
    import moize from "moize";
    import Component from "./components/Component"; // this module exports a non-memoized component

    const MemoizedFoo = moize.react(Component);

    const Consumer = () => {
      <div>
        {"I will memoize the following entry:"}
        <MemoizedFoo />
      </div>;
    };
    ```

    **Update:** Since React v16.6.0, we have a `React.memo`. It provides a higher order component which memoizes component unless the props change. To use it, simply wrap the component using React.memo before you use it.

    ```js
    const MemoComponent = React.memo(function MemoComponent(props) {
      /* render using props */
    });
    OR;
    export default React.memo(MyFunctionComponent);
    ```

47.  ### How you implement Server Side Rendering or SSR?

    React is already equipped to handle rendering on Node servers. A special version of the DOM renderer is available, which follows the same pattern as on the client side.

    ```jsx harmony
    import ReactDOMServer from "react-dom/server";
    import App from "./App";

    ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App />);
    ```

    This method will output the regular HTML as a string, which can be then placed inside a page body as part of the server response. On the client side, React detects the pre-rendered content and seamlessly picks up where it left off.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

48.  ### How to enable production mode in React?

    You should use Webpack's `DefinePlugin` method to set `NODE_ENV` to `production`, by which it strip out things like propType validation and extra warnings. Apart from this, if you minify the code, for example, Uglify's dead-code elimination to strip out development only code and comments, it will drastically reduce the size of your bundle.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

49.  ### What is a switching component?

    A _switching component_ is a component that renders one of many components. We need to use object to map prop values to components.

    For example, a switching component to display different pages based on `page` prop:

    ```jsx harmony
    import HomePage from "./HomePage";
    import AboutPage from "./AboutPage";
    import ServicesPage from "./ServicesPage";
    import ContactPage from "./ContactPage";

    const PAGES = {
      home: HomePage,
      about: AboutPage,
      services: ServicesPage,
      contact: ContactPage,
    };

    const Page = (props) => {
      const Handler = PAGES[props.page] || ContactPage;

      return <Handler {...props} />;
    };

    // The keys of the PAGES object can be used in the prop types to catch dev-time errors.
    Page.propTypes = {
      page: PropTypes.oneOf(Object.keys(PAGES)).isRequired,
    };
    ```

50.  ### What are the Pointer Events supported in React?

    _Pointer Events_ provide a unified way of handling all input events. In the old days we had a mouse and respective event listeners to handle them but nowadays we have many devices which don't correlate to having a mouse, like phones with touch surface or pens. We need to remember that these events will only work in browsers that support the _Pointer Events_ specification.

    The following event types are now available in _React DOM_:

    1. `onPointerDown`
    2. `onPointerMove`
    3. `onPointerUp`
    4. `onPointerCancel`
    5. `onGotPointerCapture`
    6. `onLostPointerCapture`
    7. `onPointerEnter`
    8. `onPointerLeave`
    9. `onPointerOver`
    10. `onPointerOut`

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

51.  ### Why should component names start with capital letter?

    If you are rendering your component using JSX, the name of that component has to begin with a capital letter otherwise React will throw an error as an unrecognized tag. This convention is because only HTML elements and SVG tags can begin with a lowercase letter.

    ```jsx harmony
    function SomeComponent {
      // Code goes here
    }
    ```

    You can define function component whose name starts with lowercase letter, but when it's imported it should have a capital letter. Here lowercase is fine:

    ```jsx harmony
    function myComponent {
      render() {
        return <div />;
      }
    }

    export default myComponent;
    ```

    While when imported in another file it should start with capital letter:

    ```jsx harmony
    import MyComponent from "./myComponent";
    ```

52.  ### What is React proptype array with shape?

    If you want to pass an array of objects to a component with a particular shape then use `React.PropTypes.shape()` as an argument to `React.PropTypes.arrayOf()`.

    ```javascript
    ReactComponent.propTypes = {
      arrayWithShape: React.PropTypes.arrayOf(
        React.PropTypes.shape({
          color: React.PropTypes.string.isRequired,
          fontSize: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired,
        })
      ).isRequired,
    };
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

53.  ### How to conditionally apply class attributes?

    You shouldn't use curly braces inside quotes because it is going to be evaluated as a string.

    ```jsx harmony
    <div className="btn-panel {this.props.visible ? 'show' : 'hidden'}">
    ```

    Instead you need to move curly braces outside (don't forget to include spaces between class names):

    ```jsx harmony
    <div className={'btn-panel ' + (this.props.visible ? 'show' : 'hidden')}>
    ```

    _Template strings_ will also work:

    ```jsx harmony
    <div className={`btn-panel ${this.props.visible ? 'show' : 'hidden'}`}>
    ```

54.  ### What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?

    The `react` package contains `React.createElement()`, `React.Component`, `React.Children`, and other helpers related to elements and component classes. You can think of these as the isomorphic or universal helpers that you need to build components. The `react-dom` package contains `ReactDOM.render()`, and in `react-dom/server` we have _server-side rendering_ support with `ReactDOMServer.renderToString()` and `ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup()`.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

55.  ### Why ReactDOM is separated from React?

    The React team worked on extracting all DOM-related features into a separate library called _ReactDOM_. React v0.14 is the first release in which the libraries are split. By looking at some of the packages, `react-native`, `react-art`, `react-canvas`, and `react-three`, it has become clear that the beauty and essence of React has nothing to do with browsers or the DOM.

    To build more environments that React can render to, React team planned to split the main React package into two: `react` and `react-dom`. This paves the way to writing components that can be shared between the web version of React and React Native.

56.  ### How to use React label element?

    If you try to render a `<label>` element bound to a text input using the standard `for` attribute, then it produces HTML missing that attribute and prints a warning to the console.

    ```jsx harmony
    <label for={'user'}>{'User'}</label>
    <input type={'text'} id={'user'} />
    ```

    Since `for` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, use `htmlFor` instead.

    ```jsx harmony
    <label htmlFor={'user'}>{'User'}</label>
    <input type={'text'} id={'user'} />
    ```

58.  ### How to pretty print JSON with React?

    We can use `<pre>` tag so that the formatting of the `JSON.stringify()` is retained:

    ```jsx harmony
    const data = { name: "John", age: 42 };

    function User {
        return <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>;
    }

    const container = createRoot(document.getElementById("container"));

    container.render(<User />);
    ```

<div>

<details>
<summary><b>See Class</b></summary>

    ```jsx harmony
    const data = { name: "John", age: 42 };

    class User extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>;
      }
    }

    React.render(<User />, document.getElementById("container"));
    ```

</details>

</div>

59.  ### How to focus an input element on page load?

    You need to use `useEffect` hook to set focus on input field during page load time for functional component.

    ```jsx harmony
    import React, { useEffect, useRef } from "react";

    const App = () => {
      const inputElRef = useRef(null);

      useEffect(() => {
        inputElRef.current.focus();
      }, []);

      return (
        <div>
          <input defaultValue={"Won't focus"} />
          <input ref={inputElRef} defaultValue={"Will focus"} />
        </div>
      );
    };

    ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"));
    ```

<div>

<details>
<summary><b>See Class</b></summary>
<p>You can do it by creating _ref_ for `input` element and using it in `componentDidMount()`:</p>

    ```jsx harmony
    class App extends React.Component {
      componentDidMount() {
        this.nameInput.focus();
      }

      render() {
        return (
          <div>
            <input defaultValue={"Won't focus"} />
            <input
              ref={(input) => (this.nameInput = input)}
              defaultValue={"Will focus"}
            />
          </div>
        );
      }
    }

    ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"));
    ```

</details>

57.  ### How does React's automatic batching improve performance?

    Automatic batching in React groups multiple state updates that occur within the same event loop into a single re-render, rather than re-rendering after each update.

    ```jsx
    setCount(c => c + 1);
    setFlag(f => !f);
    // React batches these → only one re-render
    ```

    **Result:**

    Fewer renders → less DOM work, better performance, and smoother UI.

58.  ### What are React Portals, and what problems do they solve?

    React Portals render a component's output outside its parent DOM hierarchy into a different part of the DOM tree.

    ```jsx
    import { createPortal } from "react-dom";

    function Modal({ children }) {
      return createPortal(
        <div className="modal">{children}</div>,
        document.getElementById("modal-root")
      );
    }
    ```

    **They solve the following problems:**

    * Rendering modals, tooltips, or dropdowns outside parent containers
    * Avoiding CSS overflow or z-index issues (e.g., when parent has overflow: hidden)
    * Maintaining a logical React hierarchy while adjusting visual placement in the DOM

59.  ### What is React Strict Mode and what are its benefits?

    React Strict Mode is a development feature in React that activates extra checks and warnings to help identify potential issues in your app.

    * **Detects unsafe lifecycles**: Warns about deprecated lifecycle methods
    * **Identifies side effects**: Highlights components with side effects in render methods
    * **Warns about unexpected state changes**: Catches unexpected state mutations
    * **Enforces best practices**: Flags potential problems, encouraging modern practices

    ```jsx
    <React.StrictMode>
      <App />
    </React.StrictMode>
    ```

    Wrapping components in `<React.StrictMode>` activates these development checks without affecting production builds.

60.  ### What is code splitting in a React application?

    Code splitting enhances performance by dividing code into smaller chunks loaded on demand, thereby reducing initial load times. This can be achieved through dynamic `import()` statements or using React's `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.

    ```jsx
    // Using React.lazy and Suspense
    const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

    function App() {
      return (
        <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
          <LazyComponent />
        </React.Suspense>
      );
    }
    ```

61.  ### How would one optimize the performance of React contexts to reduce rerenders?

    Optimizing context performance involves memoizing context values with `useMemo`, splitting contexts for isolated state changes, and employing selectors to rerender only necessary components.

    ```jsx
    const value = useMemo(() => ({ state, dispatch }), [state, dispatch]);
    ```

    **Additional strategies:**

    * Split contexts by concern (e.g., separate UserContext and ThemeContext)
    * Use context selectors to subscribe to specific parts of context
    * Consider using state management libraries for complex scenarios

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

62.  ### Explain one-way data flow of React

    In React, one-way data flow means data moves from parent to child components through props.

    * **Parent to child**: The parent passes data to the child
    * **State updates**: To change data, the child calls a function passed down by the parent

    ```jsx
    function Parent() {
      const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
      return <Child count={count} increment={() => setCount(count + 1)} />;
    }

    function Child({ count, increment }) {
      return <button onClick={increment}>Count: {count}</button>;
    }
    ```

    This ensures data flows in one direction, making the app more predictable.

63.  ### What are some pitfalls of using context in React?

    Context in React can lead to performance issues if not handled carefully, causing unnecessary re-renders of components that consume the context, even if only part of the context changes. Overusing context for state management can also make the code harder to maintain and understand. It's best to use context sparingly and consider other state management solutions like Redux or Zustand for more complex scenarios.

    **Common pitfalls:**

    * All consumers re-render when any part of context changes
    * Difficult to track where context values are used
    * Can lead to prop drilling in the opposite direction
    * Not suitable for frequently changing values

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

64.  ### What are some React anti-patterns?

    React anti-patterns are practices that can lead to inefficient or hard-to-maintain code. Common examples include:

    * Directly mutating state instead of using `setState`
    * Using `componentWillMount` for data fetching
    * Overusing `componentWillReceiveProps`
    * Not using keys in lists or using array index for keys
    * Excessive inline functions in render
    * Deeply nested state

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

65.  ### How do you decide between using React state, context, and external state managers?

    Choosing between React state, context, and external state managers depends on your application's complexity. Use React state for local component state, context for global state shared across multiple components, and external managers like Redux or MobX for complex state management requiring advanced features like optimizing re-renders.

    **Decision guide:**

    * **useState/useReducer**: For component-local state
    * **Context API**: For simple global state (theme, user info, language)
    * **Redux/Zustand**: For complex state with frequent updates, time-travel debugging, middleware needs

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

66.  ### Explain what happens when `setState` is called in React?

    When `setState` is called in React:

    1. **State update**: It updates the component's state, triggering a re-render of the component
    2. **Batching**: React may batch multiple setState calls into a single update for performance optimization
    3. **Re-render**: React re-renders the component (and its child components if needed) with the new state
    4. **Asynchronous**: State updates may be asynchronous, meaning React doesn't immediately apply the state change; it schedules it for later to optimize performance

    ```jsx
    function Counter() {
      const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

      const increment = () => {
        setCount(count + 1); // Calls setState to update state
      };

      return <button onClick={increment}>Count: {count}</button>;
    }
    ```

    In this example, calling `setState` (via `setCount`) triggers a re-render with the updated `count`.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

67.  ### Explain prop drilling

    Prop drilling is when you pass data from a parent component to a deeply nested child component through props, even if intermediate components don't use it.

    ```jsx
    function Grandparent() {
      const data = 'Hello from Grandparent';
      return <Parent data={data} />;
    }

    function Parent({ data }) {
      return <Child data={data} />;
    }

    function Child({ data }) {
      return <p>{data}</p>;
    }
    ```

    In this example, `data` is passed through multiple components, even though only the `Child` component uses it. Prop drilling is acceptable for small applications where the component hierarchy is shallow. When global state is needed to be accessed in deeper levels of the app, using context and/or external state managers might be better.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

68.  ### Describe lazy loading in React

    Lazy loading in React is a technique where components are loaded only when they are needed, rather than at the initial page load. This helps reduce the initial load time and improve performance by splitting the code into smaller chunks.

    ```jsx
    import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';

    const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

    function App() {
      return (
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
          <LazyComponent />
        </Suspense>
      );
    }
    ```

    In this example, `LazyComponent` is loaded only when it's rendered, and while loading, a fallback UI (Loading...) is displayed.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

69.  ### Discuss synthetic events in React

    Synthetic events in React are a wrapper around native DOM events that ensure consistent behavior across browsers. They normalize the way events are handled, providing a unified API for React applications.

    These events are wrapped in the `SyntheticEvent` object and offer methods like `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` to control event behavior. React uses event pooling to reuse event objects, which helps optimize performance.

    ```jsx
    function MyComponent() {
      const handleClick = (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        console.log('Button clicked');
      };

      return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
    }
    ```

    In this example, `handleClick` handles the click event consistently across all browsers using a synthetic event.

70.  ### What is Concurrent Mode in React, and how does it improve rendering performance?

    Concurrent Mode allows React to work on multiple tasks simultaneously without blocking the main UI thread. It enables React to prioritize updates and provide smoother rendering for complex applications.

    **Key benefits:**

    * Interruptible rendering: React can pause, resume, or abort rendering work
    * Priority-based updates: User interactions get priority over background updates
    * Better perceived performance: UI stays responsive during heavy computations

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

71.  ### How would you handle long-running tasks or expensive computations in React applications without blocking the UI?

    To avoid blocking the UI, use **Web Workers**, `setTimeout`, or `requestIdleCallback` for offloading heavy computations. Alternatively, break tasks into smaller parts and use React's Suspense or useMemo to only recompute when necessary.

    ```jsx
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        const result = computeExpensiveData();
        setData(result);
      }, 0);
    }, []);
    ```

    **Additional strategies:**

    * Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations
    * Use `useDeferredValue` for non-urgent updates
    * Use Web Workers for CPU-intensive tasks
    * Implement pagination or virtualization for large lists

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

72.  ### Explain the presentational vs container component pattern in React

    In React, the presentational vs container component pattern distinguishes between components that focus on appearance (presentational components) and those that manage logic and state (container components). Presentational components render HTML and CSS, while container components handle data and behavior. This separation leads to a cleaner and more organized codebase.

    **Presentational components:**

    * Focus on how things look
    * Receive data via props
    * Rarely have their own state
    * Are reusable and easy to test

    **Container components:**

    * Focus on how things work
    * Manage state and data fetching
    * Pass data to presentational components
    * Handle business logic

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

81.  ### What are render props in React?

    Render props in React allow code sharing between components through a prop that is a function. This function returns a React element, enabling data to be passed to child components. This technique facilitates logic reuse without relying on higher-order components or hooks.

    ```jsx
    class DataFetcher extends React.Component {
      state = { data: null };

      componentDidMount() {
        fetch(this.props.url)
          .then((response) => response.json())
          .then((data) => this.setState({ data }));
      }

      render() {
        return this.props.render(this.state.data);
      }
    }

    // Usage
    <DataFetcher
      url="/api/data"
      render={(data) => <div>{data ? data.name : 'Loading...'}</div>}
    />
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

77.  ### Explain the composition pattern in React

    The composition pattern in React involves building components by combining smaller, reusable ones instead of using inheritance. This encourages creating complex UIs by passing components as children or props.

    ```jsx
    function WelcomeDialog() {
      return (
        <Dialog>
          <h1>Welcome</h1>
          <p>Thank you for visiting our spacecraft!</p>
        </Dialog>
      );
    }

    function Dialog(props) {
      return <div className="dialog">{props.children}</div>;
    }
    ```

    **Benefits:**

    * More flexible than inheritance
    * Easier to understand and maintain
    * Promotes code reuse
    * Better separation of concerns

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

78.  ### How do you handle asynchronous data loading in React applications?

    Asynchronous data loading uses `useEffect` alongside `useState` hooks; fetching data inside `useEffect` updates state with fetched results ensuring re-renders occur with new data.

    ```jsx
    import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

    const FetchAndDisplayData = () => {
      const [info, updateInfo] = useState(null);
      const [isLoading, toggleLoading] = useState(true);

      useEffect(() => {
        const retrieveData = async () => {
          try {
            const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
            const data = await res.json();
            updateInfo(data);
          } catch (err) {
            console.error('Error fetching data:', err);
          } finally {
            toggleLoading(false);
          }
        };

        retrieveData();
      }, []);

      return (
        <div>
          {isLoading ? (
            <p>Fetching data, please wait...</p>
          ) : (
            <pre>{JSON.stringify(info, null, 2)}</pre>
          )}
        </div>
      );
    };

    export default FetchAndDisplayData;
    ```

79.  ### What are some common pitfalls when doing data fetching in React?

    Common pitfalls in data fetching with React include failing to handle loading and error states, neglecting to clean up subscriptions which can cause memory leaks, and improperly using lifecycle methods or hooks. Always ensure proper handling of these states, clean up after components, and utilize `useEffect` for side effects in functional components.

    **Common mistakes:**

    * Not handling loading states
    * Ignoring error handling
    * Memory leaks from unclosed subscriptions
    * Race conditions with async operations
    * Not cleaning up effects properly

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## React Hooks

This section focuses on **React Hooks interview questions**, covering useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo, useReducer, and custom hooks. Understanding hooks is crucial for modern React development.

80.  ### What are the benefits of using hooks in React?

    Hooks enable the use of state and other React features in functional components, replacing the need for class components. They streamline code by reducing the reliance on lifecycle methods, enhance readability, and facilitate the reuse of stateful logic across components.

    Popular hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` are used for managing state and side effects.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

81.  ### What are the rules of React hooks?

    React hooks should be called at the top level of a function, not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. They must only be used within React function components or custom hooks. These guidelines ensure proper state management and lifecycle behavior.

    **Key rules:**

    1. **Only call hooks at the top level**: Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
    2. **Only call hooks from React functions**: Call hooks from React function components or custom hooks
    3. **Custom hooks must start with 'use'**: This naming convention helps React identify hooks

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

82.  ### What is the difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect` in React?

    `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect` both handle side effects in React functional components but differ in when they run:

    * `useEffect` runs asynchronously after the DOM has rendered, making it suitable for tasks like data fetching or subscriptions.
    * `useLayoutEffect` runs synchronously after DOM updates but before the browser paints, ideal for tasks like measuring DOM elements or aligning the UI with the DOM.

    ```jsx
    import React, { useEffect, useLayoutEffect, useRef } from 'react';

    function Example() {
      const ref = useRef();

      useEffect(() => {
        console.log('useEffect: Runs after DOM paint');
      });

      useLayoutEffect(() => {
        console.log('useLayoutEffect: Runs before DOM paint');
        console.log('Element width:', ref.current.offsetWidth);
      });

      return <div ref={ref}>Hello</div>;
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

83.  ### What does the dependency array of `useEffect` affect?

    The dependency array of `useEffect` controls when the effect re-runs:

    * If it's empty `[]`, the effect runs only once after the initial render.
    * If it contains variables `[dep1, dep2]`, the effect re-runs whenever any of those variables change.
    * If omitted, the effect runs after every render.

    ```jsx
    useEffect(() => {
      // Runs on every render
    });

    useEffect(() => {
      // Runs only once on mount
    }, []);

    useEffect(() => {
      // Runs when count or name changes
    }, [count, name]);
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

84.  ### What is the `useRef` hook in React and when should it be used?

    The `useRef` hook creates a mutable object that persists through renders, allowing direct access to DOM elements, storing mutable values without causing re-renders, and maintaining references to values.

    For instance, `useRef` can be utilized to focus on an input element:

    ```jsx
    import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

    function TextInputWithFocusButton() {
      const inputEl = useRef(null);
      useEffect(() => {
        inputEl.current.focus();
      }, []);
      return <input ref={inputEl} type="text" />;
    }
    ```

    **Common use cases:**

    * Accessing DOM elements directly
    * Storing mutable values that don't trigger re-renders
    * Keeping references to previous values

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

85.  ### What is the `useCallback` hook in React and when should it be used?

    The `useCallback` hook memoizes functions to prevent their recreation on every render. This is especially beneficial when passing callbacks to optimized child components that depend on reference equality to avoid unnecessary renders.

    ```jsx
    const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
      doSomething(a, b);
    }, [a, b]);
    ```

    **When to use:**

    * When passing callbacks to child components wrapped in `React.memo`
    * When callbacks are dependencies of other hooks
    * To prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

86.  ### What is the `useMemo` hook in React and when should it be used?

    The `useMemo` hook memoizes costly calculations, recomputing them only when dependencies change. This enhances performance by avoiding unnecessary recalculations.

    ```jsx
    const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
    ```

    **When to use:**

    * For expensive computations that don't need to run on every render
    * When passing computed values to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
    * To optimize performance in components with heavy calculations

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

87.  ### What is the `useReducer` hook in React and when should it be used?

    The `useReducer` hook manages complex state logic in functional components, serving as an alternative to `useState`. It's ideal when state has multiple fields or when the next state relies on the previous one.

    The `useReducer` hook accepts a reducer function and an initial state. The `reducer` function is passed the current `state` and `action` and returns a new state.

    ```jsx
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

    // Example usage:
    dispatch({ type: 'increment' });
    ```

    **When to use:**

    * Complex state logic with multiple sub-values
    * When next state depends on previous state
    * When you want centralized state management in a component

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

88.  ### What is the `useId` hook in React and when should it be used?

    The `useId` hook generates unique IDs for elements within a component, which is crucial for accessibility by dynamically creating ids that can be used for linking form inputs and labels. It guarantees unique IDs across the application even if the component renders multiple times.

    ```jsx
    import { useId } from 'react';

    function MyComponent() {
      const id = useId();

      return (
        <div>
          <label htmlFor={id}>Name:</label>
          <input id={id} type="text" />
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

89.  ### Can you explain how to create and use custom hooks in React?

    To create and use custom hooks in React:

    1. Create a function that starts with `use` and uses built-in hooks like `useState` or `useEffect`
    2. Return the values or functions you want to share.

    **Example:**

    ```jsx
    function useForm(initialState) {
      const [formData, setFormData] = useState(initialState);
      const handleChange = (e) =>
        setFormData({ ...formData, [e.target.name]: e.target.value });
      return [formData, handleChange];
    }
    ```

    **Use the Hook:**

    ```jsx
    function MyForm() {
      const [formData, handleChange] = useForm({ name: '', email: '' });
      return <input name="name" value={formData.name} onChange={handleChange} />;
    }
    ```

    Custom hooks let you reuse logic across components, keeping your code clean.

## React Arrays & Lists

90.  ### How do you render a list of items in React?

    In React, lists are usually rendered using JavaScript's `.map()` method. Each list item should also have a unique `key` prop so React can efficiently track and update elements.

    ```jsx
    const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"];
    return (
      <ul>
        {fruits.map((fruit, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{fruit}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    );
    ```

    In this example, `.map()` is used to iterate over the array, and the `key` prop helps React identify each list item uniquely.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

91.  ### Why is the `key` prop important in React lists?

    The `key` prop is important because it helps React efficiently manage list rendering. It allows React to identify which items have changed, been added, or removed, instead of re-rendering the entire list.

    * Helps React track elements and update only what's necessary.
    * Prevents unnecessary re-renders, improving performance.
    * Best practice: Use a unique ID as the key instead of the array index whenever possible.

    ```jsx
    {
      items.map((item) => <ListItem key={item.id} value={item.value} />);
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

92.  ### What happens if we use the array index as a key in React?

    Using the array index as `key`s can lead to performance issues and unexpected behavior, especially when reordering or deleting items. React relies on keys to identify elements uniquely, and using indices can cause components to be re-rendered unnecessarily or display incorrect data.

    **Problems with index keys:**

    * Can cause issues when list items are reordered
    * May lead to incorrect updates if items are added or removed
    * Safe only for static lists that never change

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

93.  ### How do you conditionally render list items in React?

    In React, list items can be conditionally rendered using techniques like `if` statements, ternary operators, or array methods such as `.filter()` combined with `.map()`.

    ```jsx
    const users = [{name: "Aman", active: true}, {name: "Raj", active: false}];
    return (
      <ul>
        {users
          .filter(user => user.active)
          .map(user => <li key={user.name}>{user.name}</li>)}
      </ul>
    );
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

94.  ### How do you update or remove an item from a list in React state?

    State is immutable, so you cannot modify arrays directly. Instead, you create a new array using methods like `.map()` or `.filter()` and then update state with that new array.

    **Example (removing an item):**

    ```jsx
    const [list, setList] = useState(["A", "B", "C"]);

    const removeItem = (item) => {
      setList(list.filter(i => i !== item));
    };
    ```

    **Example (updating an item):**

    ```jsx
    const updateItem = (id, newValue) => {
      setList(list.map(item =>
        item.id === id ? { ...item, value: newValue } : item
      ));
    };
    ```

    In these examples, `.filter()` and `.map()` create new arrays without the removed item or with the updated item, and `setList` updates the state.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

95.  ### What are some performance tips when rendering large lists in React?

    Rendering very large lists can hurt performance, so React provides techniques and best practices to optimize them:

    * Use unique keys so React can efficiently track items.
    * Use virtualization libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtualized` to render only the visible portion of the list.
    * Memoize list items with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    * Implement pagination or lazy loading instead of rendering thousands of items at once.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

96.  ### How would you render a nested list in React?

    You can nest `.map()` calls: one for the parent array and another for the child array.

    ```jsx
    const categories = [
      { name: "Fruits", items: ["Apple", "Banana"] },
      { name: "Veggies", items: ["Carrot", "Tomato"] }
    ];

    return (
      <div>
        {categories.map(cat => (
          <div key={cat.name}>
            <h3>{cat.name}</h3>
            <ul>
              {cat.items.map(item => (
                <li key={item}>{item}</li>
              ))}
            </ul>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    );
    ```

    In this example, each level of data gets its own `.map()` loop, and both parent and child elements should have unique `key` props.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

97.  ### How do you handle dynamic addition of items in a list?

    In React, since state is immutable, you cannot directly modify the existing array. Instead, you create a new array that includes the new item and update state.

    ```jsx
    const [list, setList] = useState(["A", "B"]);

    const addItem = (item) => {
      setList([...list, item]);
    };
    ```

    In this example:

    * `[...list, item]` creates a new array with the existing items plus the new one.
    * Calling `setList` with this new array updates the state and triggers a re-render, showing the updated list in the UI.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

98.  ### How do you handle dynamic sorting or filtering of lists in React?

    In React, lists are usually stored in state, and you can sort or filter them dynamically by creating a new array based on the original list and updating the state.

    ```jsx
    const [users, setUsers] = useState([
      { name: "Aman", age: 25 },
      { name: "Raj", age: 30 },
      { name: "Sara", age: 22 }
    ]);

    // Filter active users
    const filteredUsers = users.filter(user => user.age > 24);

    // Sort by name
    const sortedUsers = [...users].sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name));
    ```

    In this example:

    * `filter` creates a new array containing only the items that meet the condition.
    * `sort` rearranges the array items; using `[...users]` ensures the original state is not mutated.
    * Updating state with the new array triggers a re-render, displaying the sorted or filtered list in the UI.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

99.  ### What is the difference between rendering lists with map() vs forEach()?

    When rendering lists, it's important to return JSX elements for each item. The choice between `map()` and `forEach()` affects this:

    * **map()**: Returns a **new array**, which can contain JSX elements to be rendered. This is the preferred method for rendering lists in React.
    * **forEach()**: Does **not return a new array**, so it cannot directly produce elements for rendering. It's only useful for side effects.

    ```jsx
    const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"];
    return (
      <ul>
        {fruits.map(fruit => <li key={fruit}>{fruit}</li>)}
      </ul>
    );
    ```

    In this example:

    * `map` returns an array of `<li>` elements, which React renders.
    * Using `forEach` here would not work, because it does not return the array of elements.

## React Forms & Events

100.  ### How are forms handled in React compared to plain HTML?

    In plain HTML, the browser's DOM manages form data. In React, form inputs are usually controlled components:

    * The form values live in state.
    * Each keystroke triggers an onChange handler to update state.
    * This makes the data predictable and easy to validate before submission.

    ```jsx
    function MyForm() {
      const [name, setName] = React.useState("");

      const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert("Submitted: " + name);
      };

      return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
          <input
            type="text"
            value={name}
            onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
          />
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
      );
    }
    ```

    In this example, the input is fully controlled by React through `value` and `onChange`.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

101.  ### How do you prevent the default form submission behavior in React?

    By using `event.preventDefault()` inside the form's `onSubmit` handler.

    ```jsx
    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      console.log("Form submitted!");
    };
    ```

    In this example, the page is stopped from reloading and lets React control what happens on submit.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

102.  ### What is event bubbling and how can you stop it in React?

    * **Event Bubbling**: When an event triggered on a child element propagates upward to its parent elements.
    * In React, you can stop it using `event.stopPropagation()`.

    ```jsx
    const handleClick = (e) => {
      e.stopPropagation();
      console.log("Child clicked, but won't bubble up.");
    };
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

103.  ### How do you handle multiple input fields in a single form in React?

    By using a single state object and updating it dynamically with `name` and `value`.

    ```jsx
    const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ name: "", email: "" });

    const handleChange = (e) => {
      setFormData({ ...formData, [e.target.name]: e.target.value });
    };
    ```

    This way, one handler can manage multiple inputs.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

104.  ### How do you reset form fields after submission in React?

    In React, form inputs are usually controlled components, meaning their values are stored in state. To reset a form, you simply reset the state that controls the inputs:

    ```jsx
    const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ name: "", email: "" });

    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      console.log(formData);
      // Reset form fields
      setFormData({ name: "", email: "" });
    };
    ```

    In this example:

    * `setFormData({ name: "", email: "" })` resets all input fields to their initial values.
    * This triggers a re-render, updating the UI with empty inputs.

## React State Management

105.  ### What is State Management in React and what is the difference between Local and Global State?

    State management refers to how an application handles and shares data across components. It ensures that the UI is updated correctly whenever the underlying data (state) changes. In React, state can be managed locally (inside components) or globally (shared across multiple components using context, Redux, Zustand, etc.).

    | **Local State**                                              | **Global State**                                              |
    | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Data managed within a single component.                        | Data shared across multiple components.                         |
    | Controlled using useState or useReducer inside the component.  | Managed using Context API, Redux, Zustand, etc.                 |
    | Used for UI-related data like form inputs, modals, or toggles. | Used for app-wide data like authentication, user info, or theme |

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

106.  ### What are some popular state management solutions in React/Next.js?

    There are several approaches and libraries for managing state in React and Next.js, depending on the scale and complexity of your application:

    * **React built-in hooks**: `useState`, `useReducer`, `useContext` – for local or small-scale state management.
    * **Context API**: Ideal for small to medium global state needs.
    * **Redux / Redux Toolkit**: Widely used for large-scale applications with complex state logic.
    * **Zustand**: Lightweight state management library for simplicity and performance.
    * **Recoil / Jotai / MobX**: Alternative libraries offering fine-grained state control.
    * **Server-side state (Next.js)**: `useSWR`, React Query, or Server Actions for fetching and caching server data efficiently.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

107.  ### When should you use Redux over Context API?

    Choosing between Redux and Context API depends on the size and complexity of your application:

    **Use Redux when:**

    * The application is large and complex.
    * You need predictable state management with debugging tools (e.g., Redux DevTools).
    * There are frequent state updates and many shared states across components.

    **Use Context API when:**

    * The application is small or medium-sized.
    * You only need to share simple state, such as theme, language, or user info.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

108.  ### What is the difference between Client State and Server State?

    | Client State                                | Server State                      |
    | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
    | Managed locally in the app                  | Managed on backend/server         |
    | Controlled by useState, useReducer, Context | Controlled via API or DB          |
    | Short-lived (browser session)               | Persistent across sessions/users  |
    | Examples: form inputs, UI toggles           | Examples: user data, product list |

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

109.  ### Explain the Context API in React

    The **Context API** in React is used to share data globally across components without prop drilling. It allows you to wrap components with a provider and access the shared value anywhere in the tree using `useContext`.

    * `createContext()`: Creates a context.
    * Avoids prop drilling.
    * Uses Provider to supply data.
    * Components consume data with `useContext` or `Consumer`.
    * Best for global values like theme, auth, language.
    * Often combined with `useState`/`useReducer` for updates.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

110.  ### What is the role of useReducer in state management?

    The `useReducer` hook in React plays an important role in state management when the logic for updating state is complex or involves multiple actions. Unlike `useState`, which is best for simple state updates, `useReducer` organizes state transitions using a reducer function, making the code more predictable and easier to maintain. It is especially useful in larger applications or when managing related pieces of state.

    * Manages complex state logic more effectively than `useState`.
    * Uses a reducer function that takes state and action, then returns a new state.
    * Returns `[state, dispatch]`, where `dispatch` triggers actions.
    * Helps keep state updates predictable and organized.
    * Often used in forms, lists, or apps needing Redux-like patterns.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

111.  ### How do you handle persistent state in React apps?

    Persistent state ensures that certain data remains available even after page reloads or across sessions. Common approaches include:

    * **localStorage or sessionStorage**: Save state that persists across page reloads.
    * **Combine state hooks with effects**: Use `useState` or `useReducer` together with `useEffect` to sync state with storage.
    * **IndexedDB**: For larger or more complex client-side storage needs.
    * **Backend storage**: Store state on a server/database via APIs for server-side persistence.
    * **State management libraries**: Use Redux, Zustand, or Context API with persistence middleware.
    * **Cookies**: Suitable for small pieces of data, like authentication tokens.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

112.  ### What is the difference between derived state and computed state in React?

    In React, sometimes you need values that depend on other state or props. These values can be handled as derived state or computed state, but they work differently:

    * **Derived state**: State calculated from props or other state. Should be avoided if it can be computed during render.
    * **Computed state**: Calculated on the fly during render or using hooks like `useMemo`. Ensures data stays consistent without storing redundant state.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

113.  ### How can you optimize state updates for performance in React?

    Optimizing state updates ensures that components re-render only when necessary, improving performance in React applications:

    * Keep state localized to the smallest possible component.
    * Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
    * Batch state updates where possible.
    * Avoid deep nested objects in state; normalize the data.
    * Use state management libraries efficiently (e.g., Redux selectors, Zustand slices).

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

114.  ### How do you handle asynchronous state updates in React?

    In React, state updates are asynchronous, so you need to handle them carefully to ensure predictable results:

    * State updates (via `setState` or the setter from `useState`) do not happen immediately.
    * Use the functional form of `setState` when the new state depends on the previous state:

    ```jsx
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
    ```

    * For multiple sequential updates, consider `useReducer` for predictable state transitions.
    * Use effects (`useEffect`) to react to changes in state asynchronously.

## React Rendering & Performance

120.  ### Can you explain what the Virtual DOM is and how React uses it?

    The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM in the browser. Instead of updating the actual DOM directly, which can be slow and costly, React first updates the Virtual DOM when a component's state or props change. React then compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one using a process called diffing, identifies the minimum set of changes needed, and updates only those parts of the real DOM. This approach makes UI updates faster and more efficient by reducing unnecessary DOM manipulations.

    **Key points:**

    * Virtual DOM is a JavaScript object representing the real DOM.
    * React updates the VDOM first, not the real DOM.
    * Uses a diffing algorithm to detect changes efficiently.
    * Only the necessary parts of the real DOM are updated.
    * Improves performance and user experience in dynamic applications.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

115.  ### What do you understand by reconciliation in React? Why is it important?

    Reconciliation in React is the process of comparing the new Virtual DOM with the previous one to determine what has changed. React then updates only the necessary parts of the real DOM, instead of re-rendering the entire UI. This approach improves performance, rendering speed, and efficiency, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

    **Key points:**

    * Reconciliation is React's process to update the DOM efficiently.
    * Compares new Virtual DOM with previous Virtual DOM using diffing.
    * Updates only the changed parts of the real DOM.
    * Improves performance, rendering speed, and efficiency.
    * Ensures a smooth and responsive UI.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

116.  ### How does `React.memo` help improve performance?

    `React.memo` is a higher-order component that prevents unnecessary re-renders of functional components. It re-renders a component only if its props have changed, which helps improve performance in components that render frequently or are part of large lists.

    **Example:** If you have a large list of items and only one item changes, `React.memo` ensures that the other list items do not re-render, saving processing time and improving UI performance.

    ```jsx
    const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(function({ value }) {
      console.log('Rendering ExpensiveComponent');
      return <div>{value}</div>;
    });
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

117.  ### If I ask you to optimize a slow React application, what techniques would you use?

    To improve performance in a slow React application, you can use several optimization techniques:

    * Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
    * Split code using `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for on-demand component loading.
    * Optimize large lists with `react-window` or `react-virtualized`.
    * Avoid anonymous functions in render; use `useCallback` instead.
    * Keep state localized as much as possible instead of placing everything in global state.
    * Use proper key props when rendering lists.
    * For server data, use libraries like React Query or SWR with caching to reduce unnecessary refetching.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

118.  ### What do you mean by code splitting and lazy loading in React?

    Code splitting and lazy loading are techniques used to improve performance by reducing the initial load time of a React application.

    * **Code Splitting**: Breaks the app's bundle into smaller chunks so the browser loads only what's necessary.
    * **Lazy Loading**: Loads components only when they are needed, instead of loading everything upfront.

    In React, this is often implemented with `React.lazy` and `<Suspense>`:

    ```jsx
    const MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));

    function App() {
      return (
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
          <MyComponent />
        </Suspense>
      );
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

119.  ### What is the difference between React.PureComponent and React.Component?

    Both `Component` and `PureComponent` are used to create class components, but they handle re-rendering differently:

    * **React.Component**: Always re-renders when `setState` is called, regardless of whether the state or props have changed.
    * **React.PureComponent**: Implements a shallow comparison of props and state; it only re-renders if something has actually changed.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

120.  ### How does React handle re-rendering when state or props change?

    Components automatically re-render when their state or props change, but React optimizes this process using the virtual DOM:

    * When state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM for the component.
    * It compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one (diffing algorithm) to detect changes.
    * Only the necessary parts of the real DOM are updated.
    * This approach improves performance by avoiding full DOM updates and ensures the UI stays in sync with the data.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

121.  ### What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in terms of rendering?

    Form inputs can be controlled or uncontrolled, and this affects how they are rendered and updated:

    * **Controlled components**: React manages the input's value through state. The UI is always in sync with React state, and updates happen on every change via `onChange`.
    * **Uncontrolled components**: The DOM manages the input's value, and React only accesses it when needed using refs. Useful for simple forms where you don't need to track every change.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

122.  ### How do useMemo and useCallback help improve performance in React?

    In React, re-renders can be expensive if functions or computed values are recreated unnecessarily. `useMemo` and `useCallback` help optimize rendering by caching values and functions:

    * **useMemo**: Memoizes the result of a computation so that it is recalculated only when its dependencies change.
    * **useCallback**: Memoizes a function so that it is not recreated on every render, preventing unnecessary re-renders in child components.
    * Both hooks help avoid expensive recalculations and unnecessary re-renders, improving performance in large or complex components.

## React Router

This section covers **React Router interview questions**, including navigation, nested routes, route guards, and React Router v6 features. These questions are essential for understanding client-side routing in React applications.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

123.  ### What is React Router?

    React Router is a powerful routing library built on top of React that helps you add new screens and flows to your application incredibly quickly, all while keeping the URL in sync with what's being displayed on the page.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

124.  ### How React Router is different from history library?

    React Router is a wrapper around the `history` library which handles interaction with the browser's `window.history` with its browser and hash histories. It also provides memory history which is useful for environments that don't have global history, such as mobile app development (React Native) and unit testing with Node.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

125.  ### What are the `<Router>` components of React Router v6?

    React Router v6 provides below 4 `<Router>` components:

    1.  `<BrowserRouter>`:Uses the HTML5 history API for standard web apps.
    2.  `<HashRouter>`:Uses hash-based routing for static servers.
    3.  `<MemoryRouter>`:Uses in-memory routing for testing and non-browser environments.
    4.  `<StaticRouter>`:Provides static routing for server-side rendering (SSR).

    The above components will create _browser_, _hash_, _memory_ and _static_ history instances. React Router v6 makes the properties and methods of the `history` instance associated with your router available through the context in the `router` object.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

126.  ### What is the purpose of `push()` and `replace()` methods of `history`?

    A history instance has two methods for navigation purpose.

    1.  `push()`
    2.  `replace()`

    If you think of the history as an array of visited locations, `push()` will add a new location to the array and `replace()` will replace the current location in the array with the new one.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

127.  ### How to perform automatic redirect after login?

    The `react-router` package provides `<Redirect>` component in React Router. Rendering a `<Redirect>` will navigate to a new location. Like server-side redirects, the new location will override the current location in the history stack.

    ```javascript
    import { Redirect } from "react-router";

    export default function Login {
        if (this.state.isLoggedIn === true) {
          return <Redirect to="/your/redirect/page" />;
        } else {
          return <div>{"Login Please"}</div>;
        }
    }
    ```

<div>

<details>
<summary><b>See Class</b></summary>

```jsx
    import React, { Component } from "react";
    import { Redirect } from "react-router";

    export default class LoginComponent extends Component {
      render() {
        if (this.state.isLoggedIn === true) {
          return <Redirect to="/your/redirect/page" />;
        } else {
          return <div>{"Login Please"}</div>;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
</details>

</div>

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

128.  ### How do you handle nested routes and route parameters in React Router?

    Nested routes allow you to create hierarchies of components, and `useParams` helps access dynamic route parameters.

    **Key techniques:**

    * `<Outlet>`: Renders child routes within a parent layout
    * `useParams`: Retrieves route parameters for dynamic routing

    ```jsx
    import {
      BrowserRouter,
      Routes,
      Route,
      Outlet,
      useParams,
    } from 'react-router-dom';

    function UserProfile() {
      const { userId } = useParams();
      return <h2>User ID: {userId}</h2>;
    }

    function App() {
      return (
        <BrowserRouter>
          <Routes>
            <Route path="user/:userId" element={<Outlet />}>
              <Route path="profile" element={<UserProfile />} />
            </Route>
          </Routes>
        </BrowserRouter>
      );
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

129.  ### How do you handle route guards or private routes in React?

    To implement private routes, create a component that checks if the user is authenticated before rendering the desired route.

    ```jsx
    import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';

    function PrivateRoute({ children }) {
      return isAuthenticated ? children : <Navigate to="/login" />;
    }
    ```

    * `PrivateRoute`: Checks authentication and either renders the children (protected routes) or redirects to the login page.
    * `<Navigate>`: Replaces the deprecated `<Redirect>` for redirecting in React Router v6+.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

130.  ### How do you manage the active route state in a multi-page React application?

    Use the `useLocation` hook to get the current route, and conditionally apply styles for the active state.

    ```jsx
    import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

    function NavBar() {
      const location = useLocation();
      return (
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li className={location.pathname === '/home' ? 'active' : ''}>Home</li>
            <li className={location.pathname === '/about' ? 'active' : ''}>About</li>
          </ul>
        </nav>
      );
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

131.  ### How do you handle 404 errors or page not found in React Router?

    To handle 404 errors or page not found in React Router, create a catch-all route at the end of your route configuration that renders a custom 404 component.

    ```jsx
    import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

    function NotFound() {
      return <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>;
    }

    function App() {
      return (
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
          <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
        </Routes>
      );
    }
    ```

    In this example, the `NotFound` component is rendered when no other routes match the URL, indicating a 404 error.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

132.  ### How to get query parameters in React Router v6?

    In React Router v6, you can use the `useSearchParams` hook to access query parameters from the URL.

    ```jsx
    import { useSearchParams } from 'react-router-dom';

    function MyComponent() {
      const [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
      const queryParam = searchParams.get('paramName');
      return <div>Query Param: {queryParam}</div>;
    }
    ```

    This hook allows you to retrieve and manipulate query parameters in React Router v6.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

133.  ### How do you perform an automatic redirect after login in React Router v6?

    To perform an automatic redirect after login in React Router v6, use the `useNavigate` hook to navigate to the desired route after successful authentication.

    ```jsx
    import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

    function Login() {
      const navigate = useNavigate();

      const handleLogin = () => {
        // Perform login logic
        navigate('/dashboard');
      };

      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    In this example, the `handleLogin` function navigates to the `/dashboard` route after successful login.

134.  ### How do you pass props to a route component in React Router v6?

    In React Router v6, you can pass props to a route component using the `element` prop in the `<Route>` component.

    ```jsx
    import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

    function MyComponent({ propValue }) {
      return <div>Prop Value: {propValue}</div>;
    }

    function App() {
      return (
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/my-route" element={<MyComponent propValue="Hello" />} />
        </Routes>
      );
    }
    ```

    In this example, the `propValue` prop is passed to the `MyComponent` component when rendering the `/my-route` route.

## React Internationalization

135.  ### What is React Intl?

    The _React Intl_ library makes internationalization in React straightforward, with off-the-shelf components and an API that can handle everything from formatting strings, dates, and numbers, to pluralization. React Intl is part of _FormatJS_ which provides bindings to React via its components and API.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

136.  ### What are the main features of React Intl?

    Below are the main features of React Intl,

    1.  Display numbers with separators.
    2.  Display dates and times correctly.
    3.  Display dates relative to "now".
    4.  Pluralize labels in strings.
    5.  Support for 150+ languages.
    6.  Runs in the browser and Node.
    7.  Built on standards.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

137.  ### What are the two ways of formatting in React Intl?

    The library provides two ways to format strings, numbers, and dates:

    1.  **Using react components:**

        ```jsx harmony
        <FormattedMessage
          id={"account"}
          defaultMessage={"The amount is less than minimum balance."}
        />
        ```

    2.  **Using an API:**

        ```javascript
        const messages = defineMessages({
          accountMessage: {
            id: "account",
            defaultMessage: "The amount is less than minimum balance.",
          },
        });

        formatMessage(messages.accountMessage);
        ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

138.  ### How to use `<FormattedMessage>` as placeholder using React Intl?

    The `<Formatted... />` components from `react-intl` return elements, not plain text, so they can't be used for placeholders, alt text, etc. In that case, you should use lower level API `formatMessage()`. You can inject the `intl` object into your component using `injectIntl()` higher-order component and then format the message using `formatMessage()` available on that object.

    ```jsx harmony
    import React from "react";
    import { injectIntl, intlShape } from "react-intl";

    const MyComponent = ({ intl }) => {
      const placeholder = intl.formatMessage({ id: "messageId" });
      return <input placeholder={placeholder} />;
    };

    MyComponent.propTypes = {
      intl: intlShape.isRequired,
    };

    export default injectIntl(MyComponent);
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

139.  ### How to access current locale with React Intl?

    You can get the current locale in any component of your application using `injectIntl()`:

    ```jsx harmony
    import { injectIntl, intlShape } from "react-intl";

    const MyComponent = ({ intl }) => (
      <div>{`The current locale is ${intl.locale}`}</div>
    );

    MyComponent.propTypes = {
      intl: intlShape.isRequired,
    };

    export default injectIntl(MyComponent);
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

140.  ### How to format date using React Intl?

     The `injectIntl()` higher-order component will give you access to the `formatDate()` method via the props in your component. The method is used internally by instances of `FormattedDate` and it returns the string representation of the formatted date.

     ```jsx harmony
     import { injectIntl, intlShape } from "react-intl";

     const stringDate = this.props.intl.formatDate(date, {
       year: "numeric",
       month: "numeric",
       day: "numeric",
     });

     const MyComponent = ({ intl }) => (
       <div>{`The formatted date is ${stringDate}`}</div>
     );

     MyComponent.propTypes = {
       intl: intlShape.isRequired,
     };

     export default injectIntl(MyComponent);
     ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

141.  ### How do you localize React applications?

    Localization typically involves libraries like react-i18next or react-intl. Set up translation files for different languages and configure the library within your app using provided hooks or components.

    ```jsx
    // Example using react-i18next
    import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

    const MyComponent = () => {
      const { t } = useTranslation();
      return <p>{t('welcome_message')}</p>;
    };
    ```

## React Testing

142.  ### How do you test React applications?

    Testing React applications can be done using Jest and React Testing Library. Jest serves as the testing framework while React Testing Library provides utilities for testing components similarly to user interactions.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

143.  ### What is React Testing Library and how is it used for testing React components?

    React Testing Library is a testing utility for React that helps test components in a way that resembles how users interact with the application. It provides functions to render components, interact with them, and assert on the rendered output.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

144.  ### How do you test React components using React Testing Library?

    To test React components using React Testing Library, you can:

    1. Render the component using `render`.
    2. Interact with the component (e.g., clicking buttons, entering text).
    3. Assert on the rendered output using queries like `getByText`, `queryByRole`, etc.

    ```jsx
    import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
    import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

    test('renders component', () => {
      render(<MyComponent />);
      const button = screen.getByRole('button');
      fireEvent.click(button);
      expect(screen.getByText('Clicked!')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
    ```

    In this example, the test renders `MyComponent`, clicks a button, and asserts that the text 'Clicked!' is present.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

145.  ### How do you test asynchronous code in React components?

    To test asynchronous code in React components, you can use `async/await` with `waitFor` from React Testing Library to handle asynchronous operations like data fetching or API calls.

    ```jsx
    import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
    import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

    test('fetches data and renders it', async () => {
      render(<MyComponent />);
      await waitFor(() => {
        expect(screen.getByText('Data loaded')).toBeInTheDocument();
      });
    });
    ```

    In this example, the test waits for the data to be loaded before asserting that the text 'Data loaded' is present.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

146.  ### How do you mock API calls in React component tests?

    To mock API calls in React component tests, you can use Jest's `jest.mock` to mock the API module and return mock data. This allows you to simulate API responses without making actual network requests.

    ```jsx
    import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';

    jest.mock('./api', () => ({
      fetchData: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve('mocked data')),
    }));

    import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

    test('fetches data and renders it', async () => {
      render(<MyComponent />);
      expect(screen.getByText('Loading...')).toBeInTheDocument();
      expect(await screen.findByText('mocked data')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
    ```

    In this example, the `fetchData` function from the `api` module is mocked to return 'mocked data' for testing purposes.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

147.  ### How do you test React hooks in functional components?

    To test React hooks in functional components, you can use the `renderHook` function from `@testing-library/react-hooks` to render the hook and test its behavior.

    ```jsx
    import { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react-hooks';
    import useCounter from './useCounter';

    test('increments counter', () => {
      const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter());
      act(() => {
        result.current.increment();
      });
      expect(result.current.count).toBe(1);
    });
    ```

    In this example, the `useCounter` hook is tested by rendering it with `renderHook` and asserting that the counter increments correctly.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

148.  ### How do you test custom hooks in React?

    To test custom hooks in React, you can use the `renderHook` function from `@testing-library/react-hooks` to render the hook and test its behavior.

    ```jsx
    import { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react-hooks';
    import useCustomHook from './useCustomHook';

    test('hook behavior', () => {
      const { result } = renderHook(() => useCustomHook());
      act(() => {
        result.current.doSomething();
      });
      expect(result.current.value).toBe('expected value');
    });
    ```

    In this example, the `useCustomHook` hook is tested by rendering it with `renderHook` and asserting its behavior.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

149.  ### What is Snapshot Testing in React?

    Snapshot Testing in React is a testing technique that captures the rendered output of a component and saves it as a snapshot. Subsequent test runs compare the current output with the saved snapshot to detect any unexpected changes. If the output differs from the snapshot, the test fails, indicating that the component's output has changed.

    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';
    import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

    test('renders correctly', () => {
      const tree = renderer.create(<MyComponent />).toJSON();
      expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
    });
    ```

    In this example, the `renderer.create` function renders the `MyComponent` and converts it to a JSON tree. The `toMatchSnapshot` function saves the snapshot of the component's output. Subsequent test runs compare the current output with the saved snapshot, ensuring the component's output remains consistent.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

150.  ### How do you test React components that use context?

    To test React components that use context, you can wrap the component in a context provider with the desired context values for testing. This allows you to simulate the context values and test the component's behavior based on those values.

    ```jsx
    import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
    import { MyContextProvider } from './MyContextProvider';
    import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

    test('renders correctly with context', () => {
      const { getByText } = render(
        <MyContextProvider value="test value">
          <MyComponent />
        </MyContextProvider>,
      );
      expect(getByText('test value')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
    ```

    In this example, the `MyComponent` is wrapped in a `MyContextProvider` with a specific context value for testing. The test verifies that the component renders correctly with the provided context value.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

151.  ### How do you test React components that use Redux?

    To test React components that use Redux, you can use the `redux-mock-store` library to create a mock store with the desired state for testing. This allows you to simulate the Redux store and test the component's behavior based on the state.

    ```jsx
    import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
    import configureStore from 'redux-mock-store';
    import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
    import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

    const mockStore = configureStore([]);

    test('renders correctly with Redux state', () => {
      const store = mockStore({ counter: 0 });
      const { getByText } = render(
        <Provider store={store}>
          <MyComponent />
        </Provider>,
      );
      expect(getByText('Counter: 0')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
    ```

    In this example, the `MyComponent` is wrapped in a `Provider` with a mock Redux store containing the initial state `{ counter: 0 }` for testing. The test verifies that the component renders correctly with the provided Redux state.

152.  ### What are the key differences between shallow rendering and full DOM rendering in React tests?

    * **Shallow Rendering**: Renders only the component being tested, without rendering its child components. Useful for isolated unit testing.
    * **Full DOM Rendering**: Mounts the entire component tree, including children, providing a complete DOM structure. Ideal for integration tests.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

159.  ### What is Shallow Renderer in React testing?

    _Shallow rendering_ is useful for writing unit test cases in React. It lets you render a component _one level deep_ and assert facts about what its render method returns, without worrying about the behavior of child components, which are not instantiated or rendered.

    For example, if you have the following component:

    ```javascript
    function MyComponent() {
      return (
        <div>
          <span className={"heading"}>{"Title"}</span>
          <span className={"description"}>{"Description"}</span>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    Then you can assert as follows:

    ```jsx harmony
    import ShallowRenderer from "react-test-renderer/shallow";

    // in your test
    const renderer = new ShallowRenderer();
    renderer.render(<MyComponent />);

    const result = renderer.getRenderOutput();

    expect(result.type).toBe("div");
    expect(result.props.children).toEqual([
      <span className={"heading"}>{"Title"}</span>,
      <span className={"description"}>{"Description"}</span>,
    ]);
    ```

160.  ### What is `TestRenderer` package in React?

    This package provides a renderer that can be used to render components to pure JavaScript objects, without depending on the DOM or a native mobile environment. This package makes it easy to grab a snapshot of the platform view hierarchy (similar to a DOM tree) rendered by a ReactDOM or React Native without using a browser or `jsdom`.

    ```jsx harmony
    import TestRenderer from "react-test-renderer";

    const Link = ({ page, children }) => <a href={page}>{children}</a>;

    const testRenderer = TestRenderer.create(
      <Link page={"https://www.facebook.com/"}>{"Facebook"}</Link>
    );

    console.log(testRenderer.toJSON());
    // {
    //   type: 'a',
    //   props: { href: 'https://www.facebook.com/' },
    //   children: [ 'Facebook' ]
    // }
    ```

161.  ### What is the purpose of ReactTestUtils package?

    _ReactTestUtils_ are provided in the `with-addons` package and allow you to perform actions against a simulated DOM for the purpose of unit testing.

162.  ### What is Jest?

    _Jest_ is a JavaScript unit testing framework created by Facebook based on Jasmine and provides automated mock creation and a `jsdom` environment. It's often used for testing components.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

163.  ### What are the advantages of Jest over Jasmine?

     There are couple of advantages compared to Jasmine:

     - Automatically finds tests to execute in your source code.
     - Automatically mocks dependencies when running your tests.
     - Allows you to test asynchronous code synchronously.
     - Runs your tests with a fake DOM implementation (via `jsdom`) so that your tests can be run on the command line.
     - Runs tests in parallel processes so that they finish sooner.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

153.  ### Give a simple example of Jest test case

     Let's write a test for a function that adds two numbers in `sum.js` file:

     ```javascript
     const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

     export default sum;
     ```

     Create a file named `sum.test.js` which contains actual test:

     ```javascript
     import sum from "./sum";

     test("adds 1 + 2 to equal 3", () => {
       expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
     });
     ```

     And then add the following section to your `package.json`:

     ```json
     {
       "scripts": {
         "test": "jest"
       }
     }
     ```

     Finally, run `yarn test` or `npm test` and Jest will print a result:

     ```console
     $ yarn test
     PASS ./sum.test.js
     ✓ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (2ms)
     ```

## React Redux

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

154.  ### What is Redux?
       Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, most commonly used with React. It helps you manage and centralize your application’s state in a single source of truth, enabling easier debugging, testing, and maintenance—especially in large or complex applications. Redux core is tiny library(about 2.5kB gzipped) and has no dependencies.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

155.  ### What are the core principles of Redux?

     Redux follows three fundamental principles:

     1. **Single source of truth:** The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store. The single state tree makes it easier to keep track of changes over time and debug or inspect the application.

      ```jsx
      const store = createStore(reducer);
      ```
     2. **State is read-only:** The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state.
      ```js
      const action = { type: 'INCREMENT' };
      store.dispatch(action);
      ```
     3. **Changes are made with pure functions(Reducers):** To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write reducers. Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action as parameters, and return the next state.

      ```jsx
      function counter(state = 0, action) {
        switch (action.type) {
          case 'INCREMENT':
            return state + 1;
          case 'DECREMENT':
            return state - 1;
          default:
            return state;
        }
      }
      ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

156.  ### What are the downsides of Redux?

     While Redux offers a powerful and predictable state management solution, it comes with a few trade-offs when compared to Flux. These include:

     1.  **Immutability is essential**
        Redux enforces a strict immutability model for state updates, which differs from Flux’s more relaxed approach. This means you must avoid mutating state directly. Many Redux-related libraries assume immutability, so your team must be disciplined in writing pure update logic. You can use tools like `redux-immutable-state-invariant`, `Immer`, or `Immutable.js` to help enforce this practice, especially during development.
     2.  **Careful selection of complementary packages**
        Redux is more minimal by design and provides extension points such as middleware and store enhancers. This has led to a large ecosystem, but it also means you must thoughtfully choose and configure additional packages for features like undo/redo, persistence, or form handling—something Flux explicitly leaves out but may be simpler to manage in smaller setups.
     3.  **Limited static type integration**
        While Flux has mature support for static type checking with tools like Flow, Redux’s type integration is less seamless. Although TypeScript is commonly used with Redux now, early Flow support was limited, and more boilerplate was required for static type safety. This may affect teams that rely heavily on type systems for large codebases.


**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

157.  ### What is the difference between `mapStateToProps()` and `mapDispatchToProps()`?

     `mapStateToProps()` is a utility which helps your component get updated state (which is updated by some other components):

     ```javascript
     const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
       return {
         todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, state.visibilityFilter),
       };
     };
     ```

     `mapDispatchToProps()` is a utility which will help your component to fire an action event (dispatching action which may cause change of application state):

     ```javascript
     const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
       return {
         onTodoClick: (id) => {
           dispatch(toggleTodo(id));
         },
       };
     };
     ```

     It is recommended to always use the “object shorthand” form for the `mapDispatchToProps`.

     Redux wraps it in another function that looks like (…args) => dispatch(onTodoClick(…args)), and pass that wrapper function as a prop to your component.

     ```javascript
     const mapDispatchToProps = {
       onTodoClick,
     };
     ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

158.  ### Can I dispatch an action in reducer?

     Dispatching an action within a reducer is an **anti-pattern**. Your reducer should be _without side effects_, simply digesting the action payload and returning a new state object. Adding listeners and dispatching actions within the reducer can lead to chained actions and other side effects.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

159.  ### How to access Redux store outside a component?

     You just need to export the store from the module where it created with `createStore()`. Also, it shouldn't pollute the global window object.

     ```javascript
     store = createStore(myReducer);

     export default store;
     ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

160.  ### What are the drawbacks of MVW pattern?

     1. DOM manipulation is very expensive which causes applications to behave slow and inefficient.
     2. Due to circular dependencies, a complicated model was created around models and views.
     3. Lot of data changes happens for collaborative applications(like Google Docs).
     4. No way to do undo (travel back in time) easily without adding so much extra code.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

161.  ### Are there any similarities between Redux and RxJS?

     These libraries are very different for very different purposes, but there are some vague similarities.

     Redux is a tool for managing state throughout the application. It is usually used as an architecture for UIs. Think of it as an alternative to (half of) Angular. RxJS is a reactive programming library. It is usually used as a tool to accomplish asynchronous tasks in JavaScript. Think of it as an alternative to Promises. Redux uses the Reactive paradigm because the Store is reactive. The Store observes actions from a distance, and changes itself. RxJS also uses the Reactive paradigm, but instead of being an architecture, it gives you basic building blocks, Observables, to accomplish this pattern.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

162.  ### How to reset state in Redux?

     You need to write a _root reducer_ in your application which delegate handling the action to the reducer generated by `combineReducers()`.

     For example, let us take `rootReducer()` to return the initial state after `USER_LOGOUT` action. As we know, reducers are supposed to return the initial state when they are called with `undefined` as the first argument, no matter the action.

     ```javascript
     const appReducer = combineReducers({
       /* your app's top-level reducers */
     });

     const rootReducer = (state, action) => {
       if (action.type === "USER_LOGOUT") {
         state = undefined;
       }

       return appReducer(state, action);
     };
     ```

     In case of using `redux-persist`, you may also need to clean your storage. `redux-persist` keeps a copy of your state in a storage engine. First, you need to import the appropriate storage engine and then, to parse the state before setting it to undefined and clean each storage state key.

     ```javascript
     const appReducer = combineReducers({
       /* your app's top-level reducers */
     });

     const rootReducer = (state, action) => {
       if (action.type === "USER_LOGOUT") {
         Object.keys(state).forEach((key) => {
           storage.removeItem(`persist:${key}`);
         });

         state = undefined;
       }

       return appReducer(state, action);
     };
     ```

163.  ### What is the difference between React context and React Redux?

     You can use **Context** in your application directly and is going to be great for passing down data to deeply nested components which what it was designed for.

     Whereas **Redux** is much more powerful and provides a large number of features that the Context API doesn't provide. Also, React Redux uses context internally but it doesn't expose this fact in the public API.

164.  ### Why are Redux state functions called reducers?

     Reducers always return the accumulation of the state (based on all previous and current actions). Therefore, they act as a reducer of state. Each time a Redux reducer is called, the state and action are passed as parameters. This state is then reduced (or accumulated) based on the action, and then the next state is returned. You could _reduce_ a collection of actions and an initial state (of the store) on which to perform these actions to get the resulting final state.

165.  ### How to make AJAX request in Redux?

     You can use `redux-thunk` middleware which allows you to define async actions.

     Let's take an example of fetching specific account as an AJAX call using _fetch API_:

     ```javascript
     export function fetchAccount(id) {
       return (dispatch) => {
         dispatch(setLoadingAccountState()); // Show a loading spinner
         fetch(`/account/${id}`, (response) => {
           dispatch(doneFetchingAccount()); // Hide loading spinner
           if (response.status === 200) {
             dispatch(setAccount(response.json)); // Use a normal function to set the received state
           } else {
             dispatch(someError);
           }
         });
       };
     }

     function setAccount(data) {
       return { type: "SET_Account", data: data };
     }
     ```

166.  ### Should I keep all component's state in Redux store?

     Keep your data in the Redux store, and the UI related state internally in the component.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

167.  ### What is the proper way to access Redux store?

     The best way to access your store in a component is to use the `connect()` function, that creates a new component that wraps around your existing one. This pattern is called _Higher-Order Components_, and is generally the preferred way of extending a component's functionality in React. This allows you to map state and action creators to your component, and have them passed in automatically as your store updates.

     Let's take an example of `<FilterLink>` component using connect:

     ```javascript
     import { connect } from "react-redux";
     import { setVisibilityFilter } from "../actions";
     import Link from "../components/Link";

     const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
       active: ownProps.filter === state.visibilityFilter,
     });

     const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => ({
       onClick: () => dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(ownProps.filter)),
     });

     const FilterLink = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Link);

     export default FilterLink;
     ```

     Due to it having quite a few performance optimizations and generally being less likely to cause bugs, the Redux developers almost always recommend using `connect()` over accessing the store directly (using context API).

     ```javascript
     function MyComponent {
       someMethod() {
         doSomethingWith(this.context.store);
       }
     }
     ```

168.  ### What is the difference between component and container in React Redux?

     **Component** is a class or function component that describes the presentational part of your application.

     **Container** is an informal term for a component that is connected to a Redux store. Containers _subscribe_ to Redux state updates and _dispatch_ actions, and they usually don't render DOM elements; they delegate rendering to presentational child components.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

169.  ### What is the purpose of the constants in Redux?

     Constants allows you to easily find all usages of that specific functionality across the project when you use an IDE. It also prevents you from introducing silly bugs caused by typos – in which case, you will get a `ReferenceError` immediately.

     Normally we will save them in a single file (`constants.js` or `actionTypes.js`).

     ```javascript
     export const ADD_TODO = "ADD_TODO";
     export const DELETE_TODO = "DELETE_TODO";
     export const EDIT_TODO = "EDIT_TODO";
     export const COMPLETE_TODO = "COMPLETE_TODO";
     export const COMPLETE_ALL = "COMPLETE_ALL";
     export const CLEAR_COMPLETED = "CLEAR_COMPLETED";
     ```

     In Redux, you use them in two places:

     1. **During action creation:**

        Let's take `actions.js`:

        ```javascript
        import { ADD_TODO } from "./actionTypes";

        export function addTodo(text) {
          return { type: ADD_TODO, text };
        }
        ```

     2. **In reducers:**

        Let's create `reducer.js`:

        ```javascript
        import { ADD_TODO } from "./actionTypes";

        export default (state = [], action) => {
          switch (action.type) {
            case ADD_TODO:
              return [
                ...state,
                {
                  text: action.text,
                  completed: false,
                },
              ];
            default:
              return state;
          }
        };
        ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

170.  ### What are the different ways to write `mapDispatchToProps()`?

     There are a few ways of binding _action creators_ to `dispatch()` in `mapDispatchToProps()`.

     Below are the possible options:

     ```javascript
     const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
       action: () => dispatch(action()),
     });
     ```

     ```javascript
     const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
       action: bindActionCreators(action, dispatch),
     });
     ```

     ```javascript
     const mapDispatchToProps = { action };
     ```

     The third option is just a shorthand for the first one.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

171.  ### What is the use of the `ownProps` parameter in `mapStateToProps()` and `mapDispatchToProps()`?

     If the `ownProps` parameter is specified, React Redux will pass the props that were passed to the component into your _connect_ functions. So, if you use a connected component:

     ```jsx harmony
     import ConnectedComponent from "./containers/ConnectedComponent";

     <ConnectedComponent user={"john"} />;
     ```

     The `ownProps` inside your `mapStateToProps()` and `mapDispatchToProps()` functions will be an object:

     ```javascript
     {
       user: "john";
     }
     ```

     You can use this object to decide what to return from those functions.

172.  ### How to structure Redux top level directories?

     Most of the applications has several top-level directories as below:

     1. **Components**: Used for _dumb_ components unaware of Redux.
     2. **Containers**: Used for _smart_ components connected to Redux.
     3. **Actions**: Used for all action creators, where file names correspond to part of the app.
     4. **Reducers**: Used for all reducers, where files name correspond to state key.
     5. **Store**: Used for store initialization.

     This structure works well for small and medium size apps.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

173.  ### What is redux-saga?

     `redux-saga` is a library that aims to make side effects (asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) in React/Redux applications easier and better.

     It is available in NPM:

     ```console
     $ npm install --save redux-saga
     ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

174.  ### What is the mental model of redux-saga?

     _Saga_ is like a separate thread in your application, that's solely responsible for side effects. `redux-saga` is a redux _middleware_, which means this thread can be started, paused and cancelled from the main application with normal Redux actions, it has access to the full Redux application state and it can dispatch Redux actions as well.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

175.  ### What are the differences between `call()` and `put()` in redux-saga?

     Both `call()` and `put()` are effect creator functions. `call()` function is used to create effect description, which instructs middleware to call the promise. `put()` function creates an effect, which instructs middleware to dispatch an action to the store.

     Let's take example of how these effects work for fetching particular user data.

     ```javascript
     function* fetchUserSaga(action) {
       // `call` function accepts rest arguments, which will be passed to `api.fetchUser` function.
       // Instructing middleware to call promise, it resolved value will be assigned to `userData` variable
       const userData = yield call(api.fetchUser, action.userId);

       // Instructing middleware to dispatch corresponding action.
       yield put({
         type: "FETCH_USER_SUCCESS",
         userData,
       });
     }
     ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

176.  ### What is Redux Thunk?

     _Redux Thunk_ middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods `dispatch()` and `getState()` as parameters.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

177.  ### What are the differences between `redux-saga` and `redux-thunk`?

     Both _Redux Thunk_ and _Redux Saga_ take care of dealing with side effects. In most of the scenarios, Thunk uses _Promises_ to deal with them, whereas Saga uses _Generators_. Thunk is simple to use and Promises are familiar to many developers, Sagas/Generators are more powerful but you will need to learn them. But both middleware can coexist, so you can start with Thunks and introduce Sagas when/if you need them.

178.  ### What is Redux DevTools?

     _Redux DevTools_ is a live-editing time travel environment for Redux with hot reloading, action replay, and customizable UI. If you don't want to bother with installing Redux DevTools and integrating it into your project, consider using Redux DevTools Extension for Chrome and Firefox.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

179.  ### What are the features of Redux DevTools?

     Some of the main features of Redux DevTools are below,

     1. Lets you inspect every state and action payload.
     2. Lets you go back in time by _cancelling_ actions.
     3. If you change the reducer code, each _staged_ action will be re-evaluated.
     4. If the reducers throw, you will see during which action this happened, and what the error was.
     5. With `persistState()` store enhancer, you can persist debug sessions across page reloads.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

180.  ### What are Redux selectors and why use them?

     _Selectors_ are functions that take Redux state as an argument and return some data to pass to the component.

     For example, to get user details from the state:

     ```javascript
     const getUserData = (state) => state.user.data;
     ```

     These selectors have two main benefits,

     1. The selector can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state
     2. The selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes

192.  ### What is Redux Form?

     _Redux Form_ works with React and Redux to enable a form in React to use Redux to store all of its state. Redux Form can be used with raw HTML5 inputs, but it also works very well with common UI frameworks like Material UI, React Widgets and React Bootstrap.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

193.  ### What are the main features of Redux Form?

     Some of the main features of Redux Form are:

     1. Field values persistence via Redux store.
     2. Validation (sync/async) and submission.
     3. Formatting, parsing and normalization of field values.

181.  ### How to add multiple middlewares to Redux?

     You can use `applyMiddleware()`.

     For example, you can add `redux-thunk` and `logger` passing them as arguments to `applyMiddleware()`:

     ```javascript
     import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from "redux";
     const createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(
       ReduxThunk,
       logger
     )(createStore);
     ```

182.  ### How to set initial state in Redux?

     You need to pass initial state as second argument to createStore:

     ```javascript
     const rootReducer = combineReducers({
       todos: todos,
       visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter,
     });

     const initialState = {
       todos: [{ id: 123, name: "example", completed: false }],
     };

     const store = createStore(rootReducer, initialState);
     ```

196.  ### What is reselect and how it works?

     _Reselect_ is a **selector library** (for Redux) which uses _memoization_ concept. It was originally written to compute derived data from Redux-like applications state, but it can't be tied to any architecture or library.

     Reselect keeps a copy of the last inputs/outputs of the last call, and recomputes the result only if one of the inputs changes. If the same inputs are provided twice in a row, Reselect returns the cached output. It's memoization and cache are fully customizable.

197.  ### What is React Dev Tools?

     _React Developer Tools_ let you inspect the component hierarchy, including component props and state. It exists both as a browser extension (for Chrome and Firefox), and as a standalone app (works with other environments including Safari, IE, and React Native).

     The official extensions available for different browsers or environments.

     1. **Chrome extension**
     2. **Firefox extension**
     3. **Standalone app** (Safari, React Native, etc)

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

198.  ### Why is DevTools not loading in Chrome for local files?

     If you opened a local HTML file in your browser (`file://...`) then you must first open _Chrome Extensions_ and check `Allow access to file URLs`.

183.  ### What are the advantages of React over Vue.js?

     React has the following advantages over Vue.js:

     1. Gives more flexibility in large apps developing.
     2. Easier to test.
     3. Suitable for mobile apps creating.
     4. More information and solutions available.

**Note:** The above list of advantages are purely opinionated and it vary based on the professional experience. But they are helpful as base parameters.

184.  ### What is the difference between React and Angular?

     Let's see the difference between React and Angular in a table format.

     | React                                                                                       | Angular                                                                                                                            |
     | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
     | React is a library and has only the View layer                                              | Angular is a framework and has complete MVC functionality                                                                          |
     | React handles rendering on the server side                                                  | AngularJS renders only on the client side but Angular 2 and above renders on the server side                                       |
     | React uses JSX that looks like HTML in JS which can be confusing                            | Angular follows the template approach for HTML, which makes code shorter and easy to understand                                    |
     | React Native, which is a React type to build mobile applications are faster and more stable | Ionic, Angular's mobile native app is relatively less stable and slower                                                            |
     | In React, data flows only in one way and hence debugging is easy                            | In Angular, data flows both way i.e it has two-way data binding between children and parent and hence debugging is often difficult |

**Note:** The above list of differences are purely opinionated and it vary based on the professional experience. But they are helpful as base parameters.

201.  ### Why React tab is not showing up in DevTools?

     When the page loads, _React DevTools_ sets a global named `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__`, then React communicates with that hook during initialization. If the website is not using React or if React fails to communicate with DevTools then it won't show up the tab.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

202.  ### What are Styled Components?

     `styled-components` is a JavaScript library for styling React applications. It removes the mapping between styles and components, and lets you write actual CSS augmented with JavaScript.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

203.  ### Give an example of Styled Components?

     Lets create `<Title>` and `<Wrapper>` components with specific styles for each.

     ```javascript
     import React from "react";
     import styled from "styled-components";

     // Create a <Title> component that renders an <h1> which is centered, red and sized at 1.5em
     const Title = styled.h1`
       font-size: 1.5em;
       text-align: center;
       color: palevioletred;
     `;

     // Create a <Wrapper> component that renders a <section> with some padding and a papayawhip background
     const Wrapper = styled.section`
       padding: 4em;
       background: papayawhip;
     `;
     ```

     These two variables, `Title` and `Wrapper`, are now components that you can render just like any other react component.

     ```jsx harmony
     <Wrapper>
       <Title>{"Lets start first styled component!"}</Title>
     </Wrapper>
     ```

## Miscellaneous

204.  ### What are the main features of Reselect library?

     Let's see the main features of Reselect library,

     1. Selectors can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state.
     2. Selectors are efficient. A selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes.
     3. Selectors are composable. They can be used as input to other selectors.

223. #### Give an example of Reselect usage?

     Let's take calculations and different amounts of a shipment order with the simplified usage of Reselect:

     ```javascript
     import { createSelector } from "reselect";

     const shopItemsSelector = (state) => state.shop.items;
     const taxPercentSelector = (state) => state.shop.taxPercent;

     const subtotalSelector = createSelector(shopItemsSelector, (items) =>
       items.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.value, 0)
     );

     const taxSelector = createSelector(
       subtotalSelector,
       taxPercentSelector,
       (subtotal, taxPercent) => subtotal * (taxPercent / 100)
     );

     export const totalSelector = createSelector(
       subtotalSelector,
       taxSelector,
       (subtotal, tax) => ({ total: subtotal + tax })
     );

     let exampleState = {
       shop: {
         taxPercent: 8,
         items: [
           { name: "apple", value: 1.2 },
           { name: "orange", value: 0.95 },
         ],
       },
     };

     console.log(subtotalSelector(exampleState)); // 2.15
     console.log(taxSelector(exampleState)); // 0.172
     console.log(totalSelector(exampleState)); // { total: 2.322 }
     ```

205.  ### Can Redux only be used with React?

     Redux can be used as a data store for any UI layer. The most common usage is with React and React Native, but there are bindings available for Angular, Angular 2, Vue, Mithril, and more. Redux simply provides a subscription mechanism which can be used by any other code.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

206.  ### Do you need to have a particular build tool to use Redux?

     Redux is originally written in ES6 and transpiled for production into ES5 with Webpack and Babel. You should be able to use it regardless of your JavaScript build process. Redux also offers a UMD build that can be used directly without any build process at all.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

207.  ### How Redux Form `initialValues` get updated from state?

     You need to add `enableReinitialize : true` setting.

     ```javascript
     const InitializeFromStateForm = reduxForm({
       form: "initializeFromState",
       enableReinitialize: true,
     })(UserEdit);
     ```

     If your `initialValues` prop gets updated, your form will update too.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

185.  ### How React PropTypes allow different types for one prop?

     You can use `oneOfType()` method of `PropTypes`.

     For example, the height property can be defined with either `string` or `number` type as below:

     ```javascript
     Component.propTypes = {
       size: PropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.string, PropTypes.number]),
     };
     ```

209.  ### Can I import an SVG file as react component?

     You can import SVG directly as component instead of loading it as a file. This feature is available with `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher.

     ```jsx harmony
     import { ReactComponent as Logo } from "./logo.svg";

     const App = () => (
       <div>
         {/* Logo is an actual react component */}
         <Logo />
       </div>
     );
     ```

     **Note**: Don't forget about the curly braces in the import.

210.  ### What is render hijacking in react?

     The concept of render hijacking is the ability to control what a component will output from another component. It means that you decorate your component by wrapping it into a Higher-Order component. By wrapping, you can inject additional props or make other changes, which can cause changing logic of rendering. It does not actually enable hijacking, but by using HOC you make your component behave differently.

186.  ### How to pass numbers to React component?

     We can pass `numbers` as `props` to React component using curly braces `{}` where as `strings` in double quotes `""` or single quotes `''`

     ```jsx
     import React from "react";

     const ChildComponent = ({ name, age }) => {
       return (
         <>
           My Name is {name} and Age is {age}
         </>
       );
     };

     const ParentComponent = () => {
       return (
         <>
           <ChildComponent name="Chetan" age={30} />
         </>
       );
     };

     export default ParentComponent;
     ```

212.  ### Do I need to keep all my state into Redux? Should I ever use react internal state?

     It is up to the developer's decision, i.e., it is developer's job to determine what kinds of state make up your application, and where each piece of state should live. Some users prefer to keep every single piece of data in Redux, to maintain a fully serializable and controlled version of their application at all times. Others prefer to keep non-critical or UI state, such as “is this dropdown currently open”, inside a component's internal state.

     Below are the rules of thumb to determine what kind of data should be put into Redux

     1. Do other parts of the application care about this data?
     2. Do you need to be able to create further derived data based on this original data?
     3. Is the same data being used to drive multiple components?
     4. Is there value to you in being able to restore this state to a given point in time (ie, time travel debugging)?
     5. Do you want to cache the data (i.e, use what's in state if it's already there instead of re-requesting it)?

213.  ### What is the purpose of registerServiceWorker in React?

     React creates a service worker for you without any configuration by default. The service worker is a web API that helps you cache your assets and other files so that when the user is offline or on a slow network, he/she can still see results on the screen, as such, it helps you build a better user experience, that's what you should know about service worker for now. It's all about adding offline capabilities to your site.

     ```jsx
     import React from "react";
     import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
     import App from "./App";
     import registerServiceWorker from "./registerServiceWorker";

     ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
     registerServiceWorker();
     ```

214.  ### What is React memo function?

     Class components can be restricted from re-rendering when their input props are the same using **PureComponent or shouldComponentUpdate**. Now you can do the same with function components by wrapping them in **React.memo**.

     ```jsx
     const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
       /* only rerenders if props change */
     });
     ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

215.  ### What is React lazy function?

     The `React.lazy` function lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component. It will automatically load the bundle containing the `OtherComponent` when the component gets rendered. This must return a Promise which resolves to a module with a default export containing a React component.

     ```jsx
     const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./OtherComponent"));

     function MyComponent() {
       return (
         <div>
           <OtherComponent />
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

     **Note:**
     `React.lazy` and `Suspense` is not yet available for server-side rendering. If you want to do code-splitting in a server rendered app, we still recommend React Loadable.

216.  ### How to prevent unnecessary updates using setState?

     You can compare the current value of the state with an existing state value and decide whether to rerender the page or not. If the values are the same then you need to return **null** to stop re-rendering otherwise return the latest state value.

     For example, the user profile information is conditionally rendered as follows,

     ```jsx
     getUserProfile = (user) => {
       const latestAddress = user.address;
       this.setState((state) => {
         if (state.address === latestAddress) {
           return null;
         } else {
           return { title: latestAddress };
         }
       });
     };
     ```

217.  ### What are hooks?

     Hooks is a special JavaScript function that allows you use state and other React features without writing a class. This pattern has been introduced as a new feature in React 16.8 and helped to isolate the stateful logic from the components.

     Let's see an example of useState hook:

     ```jsx
     import { useState } from "react";

     function Example() {
       // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
       const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

       return (
         <>
           <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
           <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
         </>
       );
     }
     ```

     **Note:** Hooks can be used inside an existing function component without rewriting the component.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

218.  ### What rules need to be followed for hooks?

     You need to follow two rules in order to use hooks,

     1. **Call Hooks only at the top level of your react functions:** You should always use hooks at the top level of react function before any early returns. i.e, You shouldn’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. This will ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders and it preserves the state of Hooks between multiple re-renders due to `useState` and `useEffect` calls.

     Let's see the difference using an example,
     **Correct usage:**:
     ```jsx
     function UserProfile() {
      // Correct: Hooks called at the top level
      const [name, setName] = useState('John');
      const [country, setCountry] = useState('US');

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Name: {name}</h1>
          <p>Country: {country}</p>
        </div>
      );
     }
     ```
     **Incorrect usage:**:
     ```jsx
     function UserProfile() {
      const [name, setName] = useState('John');

      if (name === 'John') {
        // Incorrect: useState is called inside a conditional
        const [country, setCountry] = useState('US');
      }

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Name: {name}</h1>
          <p>Country: {country}</p> {/* This will throw an error if the name condition isn't met */}
        </div>
      );
     }
     ```
     The `useState` hook for the country field is being called conditionally within an `if` block. This can lead to inconsistent state behavior and may cause hooks to be called in a different order on each re-render.

     2. **Call Hooks from React Functions only:** You shouldn’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions or class components. Instead, you should call them from either function components or custom hooks.

     Let's find the difference of correct and incorrect usage with below examples,

     **Correct usage:**:
     ```jsx
     //Example1:
     function Counter() {
      // Correct: useState is used inside a functional component
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

      return <div>Counter: {count}</div>;
     }
     //Example2:
     function useFetchData(url) {
      const [data, setData] = useState(null);

      useEffect(() => {
        fetch(url)
          .then((response) => response.json())
          .then((data) => setData(data));
      }, [url]);

      return data;
     }

     function UserProfile() {
      // Correct: Using a custom hook here
      const user = useFetchData('https://some-api.com/user');

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>{user ? user.name : 'Loading profile...'}</h1>
        </div>
      );
     }
     ```
     **Incorrect usage:**:
     ```jsx
      //Example1
      function normalFunction() {
        // Incorrect: Can't call hooks in normal functions
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      }

      //Example2
      function fetchData(url) {
        // Incorrect: Hooks can't be used in non-React functions
        const [data, setData] = useState(null);

        useEffect(() => {
          fetch(url)
            .then((response) => response.json())
            .then((data) => setData(data));
        }, [url]);

        return data;
      }
     ```
     In the above incorrect usage example, both `useState` and `useEffect` are used in non-React functions(`normalFunction` and `fetchData`), which is not allowed.

187.  ### How to ensure hooks followed the rules in your project?

        React team released an ESLint plugin called **eslint-plugin-react-hooks** that enforces Hook's two rules. It is part of Hooks API. You can add this plugin to your project using the below command,

        ```javascript
        npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev
        ```

        And apply the below config in your ESLint config file,

        ```javascript
        // Your ESLint configuration
        {
          "plugins": [
            // ...
            "react-hooks"
          ],
          "rules": {
            // ...
            "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error"
          }
        }
        ```

        This plugin also provide another important rule through `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`. It ensures that the dependencies of useEffect, useCallback, and useMemo hooks are correctly listed to avoid potential bugs.

        ```jsx
        useEffect(() => {
          // Forgetting `message` will result in incorrect behavior
          console.log(message);
        }, []); // Here `message` should be a dependency
        ```
        The recommended `eslint-config-react-app` preset already includes the hooks rules of this plugin.
        For example, the linter enforce proper naming convention for hooks. If you rename your custom hooks which as prefix "use" to something else then linter won't allow you to call built-in hooks such as useState, useEffect etc inside of your custom hook anymore.

        **Note:** This plugin is intended to use in Create React App by default.

220.  ### What are the differences between Flux and Redux?

     Below are the major differences between Flux and Redux

     | Flux                                           | Redux                                      |
     | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
     | State is mutable                               | State is immutable                         |
     | The Store contains both state and change logic | The Store and change logic are separate    |
     | There are multiple stores exist                | There is only one store exist              |
     | All the stores are disconnected and flat       | Single store with hierarchical reducers    |
     | It has a singleton dispatcher                  | There is no concept of dispatcher          |
     | React components subscribe to the store        | Container components uses connect function |

221.  ### What are the benefits of React Router V4?

     Below are the main benefits of React Router V4 module,

     1. In React Router v4(version 4), the API is completely about components. A router can be visualized as a single component(`<BrowserRouter>`) which wraps specific child router components(`<Route>`).
     2. You don't need to manually set history. The router module will take care history by wrapping routes with `<BrowserRouter>` component.
     3. The application size is reduced by adding only the specific router module(Web, core, or native)

222.  ### Can you describe about componentDidCatch lifecycle method signature?

     The **componentDidCatch** lifecycle method is invoked after an error has been thrown by a descendant component. The method receives two parameters,

     1. error: - The error object which was thrown
     2. info: - An object with a componentStack key contains the information about which component threw the error.

     The method structure would be as follows

     ```javascript
     componentDidCatch(error, info);
     ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

223.  ### In which scenarios do error boundaries not catch errors?

     Below are the cases in which error boundaries don't work,

     1. Inside Event handlers
     2. Asynchronous code using **setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame** callbacks
     3. During Server side rendering
     4. When errors thrown in the error boundary code itself

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

224.  ### What is the proper placement for error boundaries?
     The granularity of error boundaries usage is up to the developer based on project needs. You can follow either of these approaches,
     1. You can wrap top-level route components to display a generic error message for the entire application.
     2. You can also wrap individual components in an error boundary to protect them from crashing the rest of the application.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

225.  ### What is the benefit of component stack trace from error boundary?

     Apart from error messages and javascript stack, React16 will display the component stack trace with file names and line numbers using error boundary concept.

     For example, BuggyCounter component displays the component stack trace as below,

     ![stacktrace](images/error_boundary.png)

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

226.  ### What are default props?

     The _defaultProps_ can be defined as a property on the component to set the default values for the props. These default props are used when props not supplied(i.e., undefined props), but not for `null` or `0` as props. That means, If you provide null value then it remains null value. It's the same behavior with 0 as well.

     For example, let us create color default prop for the button component,

     ```javascript
     function MyButton {
       // ...
     }

     MyButton.defaultProps = {
       color: "red",
     };
     ```

     If `props.color` is not provided then it will set the default value to 'red'. i.e, Whenever you try to access the color prop it uses the default value

     ```javascript
     function MyButton() {
       return <MyButton />; // props.color will contain red value
     }
     ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

227.  ### What is the purpose of displayName class property?

     The displayName string is used in debugging messages. Usually, you don’t need to set it explicitly because it’s inferred from the name of the function or class that defines the component. You might want to set it explicitly if you want to display a different name for debugging purposes or when you create a higher-order component.

     For example, To ease debugging, choose a display name that communicates that it’s the result of a withSubscription HOC.

     ```javascript
     function withSubscription(WrappedComponent) {
       class WithSubscription extends React.Component {
         /* ... */
       }
       WithSubscription.displayName = `WithSubscription(${getDisplayName(
         WrappedComponent
       )})`;
       return WithSubscription;
     }
     function getDisplayName(WrappedComponent) {
       return (
         WrappedComponent.displayName || WrappedComponent.name || "Component"
       );
     }
     ```

228.  ### What is the browser support for react applications?
     React supports all popular browsers, including Internet Explorer 9 and above, although some polyfills are required for older browsers such as IE 9 and IE 10. If you use **es5-shim and es5-sham** polyfill then it even support old browsers that doesn't support ES5 methods.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

229.  ### What is code-splitting?

     Code-Splitting is a feature supported by bundlers like Webpack and Browserify which can create multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime. The react project supports code splitting via dynamic import() feature.

     For example, in the below code snippets, it will make moduleA.js and all its unique dependencies as a separate chunk that only loads after the user clicks the 'Load' button.

     **moduleA.js**

     ```javascript
     const moduleA = "Hello";

     export { moduleA };
     ```

     **App.js**

     ```javascript
     export default function App {
       function handleClick() {
         import("./moduleA")
           .then(({ moduleA }) => {
             // Use moduleA
           })
           .catch((err) => {
             // Handle failure
           });
       };

      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Load</button>
        </div>
      );
     }
     ```

<div>

<details>
<summary><b>See Class</b></summary>

```javascript
    import React, { Component } from "react";

     class App extends Component {
       handleClick = () => {
         import("./moduleA")
           .then(({ moduleA }) => {
             // Use moduleA
           })
           .catch((err) => {
             // Handle failure
           });
       };

       render() {
         return (
           <div>
             <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Load</button>
           </div>
         );
       }
     }

     export default App;
```

</details>

</div>

230.  ### What are Keyed Fragments?

     The Fragments declared with the explicit `<React.Fragment>` syntax may have keys. The general use case is mapping a collection to an array of fragments as below,

     ```javascript
     function Glossary(props) {
       return (
         <dl>
           {props.items.map((item) => (
             // Without the `key`, React will fire a key warning
             <React.Fragment key={item.id}>
               <dt>{item.term}</dt>
               <dd>{item.description}</dd>
             </React.Fragment>
           ))}
         </dl>
       );
     }
     ```

     **Note:** key is the only attribute that can be passed to Fragment. In the future, there might be a support for additional attributes, such as event handlers.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

231.  ### Does React support all HTML attributes?

     As of React 16, both standard or custom DOM attributes are fully supported. Since React components often take both custom and DOM-related props, React uses the camelCase convention just like the DOM APIs.

     Let us take few props with respect to standard HTML attributes,

     ```javascript
     <div tabIndex="-1" />      // Just like node.tabIndex DOM API
     <div className="Button" /> // Just like node.className DOM API
     <input readOnly={true} />  // Just like node.readOnly DOM API
     ```

     These props work similarly to the corresponding HTML attributes, with the exception of the special cases. It also support all SVG attributes.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

232.  ### When component props defaults to true?

     If you pass no value for a prop, it defaults to true. This behavior is available so that it matches the behavior of HTML.

     For example, below expressions are equivalent,

     ```javascript
     <MyInput autocomplete />

     <MyInput autocomplete={true} />
     ```

     **Note:** It is not recommended to use this approach because it can be confused with the ES6 object shorthand (example, `{name}` which is short for `{name: name}`)

233.  ### What is NextJS and major features of it?

     Next.js is a popular and lightweight framework for static and server‑rendered applications built with React. It also provides styling and routing solutions. Below are the major features provided by NextJS,

     1. Server-rendered by default
     2. Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
     3. Simple client-side routing (page based)
     4. Webpack-based dev environment which supports (HMR)
     5. Able to implement with Express or any other Node.js HTTP server
     6. Customizable with your own Babel and Webpack configurations

234.  ### How do you pass an event handler to a component?

     You can pass event handlers and other functions as props to child components. The functions can be passed to child component as below,

     ```jsx
     function Button({ onClick }) {
       return <button onClick={onClick}>Download</button>;
     }

     export default function downloadExcel() {
       function handleClick() {
         alert("Downloaded");
       }

       return <Button onClick={handleClick}></Button>;
     }
     ```

235.  ### How to prevent a function from being called multiple times?

     If you use an event handler such as **onClick or onScroll** and want to prevent the callback from being fired too quickly, then you can limit the rate at which callback is executed. This can be achieved in the below possible ways,

     1. **Throttling:** Changes based on a time based frequency. For example, it can be used using \_.throttle lodash function
     2. **Debouncing:** Publish changes after a period of inactivity. For example, it can be used using \_.debounce lodash function
     3. **RequestAnimationFrame throttling:** Changes based on requestAnimationFrame. For example, it can be used using raf-schd lodash function

236.  ### How JSX prevents Injection Attacks?

     React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that’s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered.

     For example, you can embed user input as below,

     ```javascript
     const name = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;
     const element = <h1>{name}</h1>;
     ```

     This way you can prevent XSS(Cross-site-scripting) attacks in the application.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

237.  ### How do you update rendered elements?

     You can update UI(represented by rendered element) by passing the newly created element to ReactDOM's render method.

     For example, lets take a ticking clock example, where it updates the time by calling render method multiple times,

     ```javascript
     function tick() {
       const element = (
         <div>
           <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
           <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
         </div>
       );
       ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById("root"));
     }

     setInterval(tick, 1000);
     ```

238.  ### How do you say that props are readonly?

     When you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props.

     Let us take a below capital function,

     ```javascript
     function capital(amount, interest) {
       return amount + interest;
     }
     ```

     The above function is called “pure” because it does not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs. Hence, React has a single rule saying "All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props."

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

239.  ### What are the conditions to safely use the index as a key?

     There are three conditions to make sure, it is safe use the index as a key.

     1. The list and items are static– they are not computed and do not change
     2. The items in the list have no ids
     3. The list is never reordered or filtered.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

240.  ### Should keys be globally unique?

     The keys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings but they don’t need to be globally unique. i.e, You can use the same keys with two different arrays.

     For example, the below `Book` component uses two arrays with different arrays,

     ```javascript
     function Book(props) {
       const index = (
         <ul>
           {props.pages.map((page) => (
             <li key={page.id}>{page.title}</li>
           ))}
         </ul>
       );
       const content = props.pages.map((page) => (
         <div key={page.id}>
           <h3>{page.title}</h3>
           <p>{page.content}</p>
           <p>{page.pageNumber}</p>
         </div>
       ));
       return (
         <div>
           {index}
           <hr />
           {content}
         </div>
       );
     }

241.  ### What is the popular choice for form handling?

     `Formik` is a form library for react which provides solutions such as validation, keeping track of the visited fields, and handling form submission.

     In detail, You can categorize them as follows,

     1. Getting values in and out of form state
     2. Validation and error messages
     3. Handling form submission

     It is used to create a scalable, performant, form helper with a minimal API to solve annoying stuff.

242.  ### What are the advantages of formik over redux form library?

     Below are the main reasons to recommend formik over redux form library,

     1. The form state is inherently short-term and local, so tracking it in Redux (or any kind of Flux library) is unnecessary.
     2. Redux-Form calls your entire top-level Redux reducer multiple times ON EVERY SINGLE KEYSTROKE. This way it increases input latency for large apps.
     3. Redux-Form is 22.5 kB minified gzipped whereas Formik is 12.7 kB

243.  ### Why are you not required to use inheritance?
     In React, it is recommended to use composition over inheritance to reuse code between components. Both Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a component’s look and behavior explicitly and safely.
     Whereas, If you want to reuse non-UI functionality between components, it is suggested to extract it into a separate JavaScript module. Later components import it and use that function, object, or class, without extending it.

244.  ### Can I use web components in react application?

     Yes, you can use web components in a react application. Even though many developers won't use this combination, it may require especially if you are using third-party UI components that are written using Web Components.

     For example, let us use `Vaadin` date picker web component as below,

     ```javascript
     import "./App.css";
     import "@vaadin/vaadin-date-picker";
     export default function App() {
       return (
         <div className="App">
           <vaadin-date-picker label="When were you born?"></vaadin-date-picker>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

245.  ### What is dynamic import?

     You can achieve code-splitting in your app using dynamic import.

     Let's take an example of addition,

     1. **Normal Import**

     ```javascript
     import { add } from "./math";
     console.log(add(10, 20));
     ```

     2. **Dynamic Import**

     ```javascript
     import("./math").then((math) => {
       console.log(math.add(10, 20));
     });
     ```

246.  ### What are loadable components?

     With the release of React 18, React.lazy and Suspense are now available for server-side rendering. However, prior to React 18, it was recommended to use Loadable Components for code-splitting in a server-side rendered app because React.lazy and Suspense were not available for server-side rendering. Loadable Components lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component. For example, you can use Loadable Components to load the OtherComponent in a separate bundle like this:

     ```javascript
     import loadable from "@loadable/component";

     const OtherComponent = loadable(() => import("./OtherComponent"));

     function MyComponent() {
       return (
         <div>
           <OtherComponent />
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

     Now OtherComponent will be loaded in a separated bundle
     Loadable Components provides additional benefits beyond just code-splitting, such as automatic code reloading, error handling, and preloading. By using Loadable Components, you can ensure that your application loads quickly and efficiently, providing a better user experience for your users.

247.  ### What is suspense component?

     React Suspense is a built-in feature that lets you defer rendering part of your component tree until some condition(asynchronous operation) is met—usually, data or code has finished loading. While waiting, Suspense lets you display a fallback UI like a spinner or placeholder.

     1. Lazy loading components uses suspense feature,

        If the module containing the dynamic import is not yet loaded by the time parent component renders, you must show some fallback content while you’re waiting for it to load using a loading indicator. This can be done using **Suspense** component.

        ```javascript
        const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./OtherComponent"));

        function MyComponent() {
          return (
            <div>
              <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
                <OtherComponent />
              </Suspense>
            </div>
          );
        }
        ```
        The above component shows fallback UI instead real component until `OtherComponent` is fully loaded.

     2. As an another example, suspend until async data(data fetching) is ready
      ```jsx
        function UserProfile() {
          const user = use(fetchUser()); // throws a promise internally
          return <div>{user.name}</div>;
        }

        function App() {
          return (
            <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading user...</div>}>
              <UserProfile />
            </Suspense>
          );
        }

    ```

248.  ### What is route based code splitting?

     One of the best place to do code splitting is with routes. The entire page is going to re-render at once so users are unlikely to interact with other elements in the page at the same time. Due to this, the user experience won't be disturbed.

     Let us take an example of route based website using libraries like React Router with React.lazy,

     ```javascript
     import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";
     import React, { Suspense, lazy } from "react";

     const Home = lazy(() => import("./routes/Home"));
     const About = lazy(() => import("./routes/About"));

     const App = () => (
       <Router>
         <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
           <Switch>
             <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
             <Route path="/about" component={About} />
           </Switch>
         </Suspense>
       </Router>
     );
     ```

     In the above code, the code splitting will happen at each route level.

249.  ### What is the purpose of default value in context?

     The defaultValue argument is only used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree. This can be helpful for testing components in isolation without wrapping them.

     Below code snippet provides default theme value as Luna.

     ```javascript
     const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);
     ```

250.  ### What is diffing algorithm?

     React needs to use algorithms to find out how to efficiently update the UI to match the most recent tree. The diffing algorithms is generating the minimum number of operations to transform one tree into another. However, the algorithms have a complexity in the order of O(n³) where n is the number of elements in the tree.

     In this case, displaying 1000 elements would require in the order of one billion comparisons. This is far too expensive. Instead, React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:

     1. Two elements of different types will produce different trees.
     2. The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

251.  ### What are the rules covered by diffing algorithm?

     When diffing two trees, React first compares the two root elements. The behavior is different depending on the types of the root elements. It covers the below rules during reconciliation algorithm,

     1. **Elements Of Different Types:**
        Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch. For example, elements `<a>` to `<img>`, or from `&lt;Article&gt;` to `&lt;Comment&gt;` of different types lead a full rebuild.
     2. **DOM Elements Of The Same Type:**
        When comparing two React DOM elements of the same type, React looks at the attributes of both, keeps the same underlying DOM node, and only updates the changed attributes. Lets take an example with same DOM elements except className attribute,

        ```javascript
        <div className="show" title="ReactJS" />

        <div className="hide" title="ReactJS" />
        ```

     3. **Component Elements Of The Same Type:**
        When a component updates, the instance stays the same, so that state is maintained across renders. React updates the props of the underlying component instance to match the new element, and calls componentWillReceiveProps() and componentWillUpdate() on the underlying instance. After that, the render() method is called and the diff algorithm recurses on the previous result and the new result.
     4. **Recursing On Children:**
        when recursing on the children of a DOM node, React just iterates over both lists of children at the same time and generates a mutation whenever there’s a difference. For example, when adding an element at the end of the children, converting between these two trees works well.

        ```javascript
        <ul>
          <li>first</li>
          <li>second</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>first</li>
          <li>second</li>
          <li>third</li>
        </ul>

        ```

     5. **Handling keys:**
        React supports a key attribute. When children have keys, React uses the key to match children in the original tree with children in the subsequent tree. For example, adding a key can make the tree conversion efficient,

     ```javascript
     <ul>
       <li key="2015">Duke</li>
       <li key="2016">Villanova</li>
     </ul>

     <ul>
       <li key="2014">Connecticut</li>
       <li key="2015">Duke</li>
       <li key="2016">Villanova</li>
     </ul>
     ```

188.  ### When do you need to use refs?

     There are few use cases to go for refs,

     1. Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.
     2. Triggering imperative animations.
     3. Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

189.  ### Must prop be named as render for render props?

     Even though the pattern named render props, you don’t have to use a prop named render to use this pattern. i.e, Any prop that is a function that a component uses to know what to render is technically a “render prop”. Lets take an example with the children prop for render props,

     ```javascript
     <Mouse
       children={(mouse) => (
         <p>
           The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}
         </p>
       )}
     />
     ```

     Actually children prop doesn’t need to be named in the list of “attributes” in JSX element. Instead, you can keep it directly inside element,

     ```javascript
     <Mouse>
       {(mouse) => (
         <p>
           The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}
         </p>
       )}
     </Mouse>
     ```

     While using this above technique(without any name), explicitly state that children should be a function in your propTypes.

     ```javascript
     Mouse.propTypes = {
       children: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
     };
     ```

190.  ### What are the problems of using render props with pure components?
     If you create a function inside a render method, it negates the purpose of pure component. Because the shallow prop comparison will always return false for new props, and each render in this case will generate a new value for the render prop. You can solve this issue by defining the render function as instance method.

191.  ### What is windowing technique?
     Windowing is a technique that only renders a small subset of your rows at any given time, and can dramatically reduce the time it takes to re-render the components as well as the number of DOM nodes created. If your application renders long lists of data then this technique is recommended. Both react-window and react-virtualized are popular windowing libraries which provides several reusable components for displaying lists, grids, and tabular data.

192.  ### How do you print falsy values in JSX?

     The falsy values such as false, null, undefined, and true are valid children but they don't render anything. If you still want to display them then you need to convert it to string. Let's take an example on how to convert to a string,

     ```javascript
     <div>My JavaScript variable is {String(myVariable)}.</div>
     ```

193.  ### What is the typical use case of portals?
     React Portals are primarily used to render UI components such as **modals, tooltips, dropdowns, hovercards, and notifications** outside of their parent component's DOM tree. This helps avoid common CSS issues caused by parent elements, such as:

     *   `**overflow: hidden**` on parent elements clipping or hiding child elements like modals or tooltips,
     *   **stacking context and** `**z-index**` **conflicts** created by parent containers that prevent child elements from appearing above other content.

     That means, you need to visually “break out” of its container. By rendering these UI elements into a separate DOM node (often directly under `<body>`), portals ensure they appear above all other content and are not restricted by the parent’s CSS or layout constraints, resulting in correct positioning and visibility regardless of the parent’s styling.

194.  ### How do you set default value for uncontrolled component?

     In React, the value attribute on form elements will override the value in the DOM. With an uncontrolled component, you might want React to specify the initial value, but leave subsequent updates uncontrolled. To handle this case, you can specify a **defaultValue** attribute instead of **value**.

     ```javascript
     render() {
       return (
         <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
           <label>
             User Name:
             <input
               defaultValue="John"
               type="text"
               ref={this.input} />
           </label>
           <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
         </form>
       );
     }
     ```

     The same applies for `select` and `textArea` inputs. But you need to use **defaultChecked** for `checkbox` and `radio` inputs.

195.  ### What is your favorite React stack?
     Even though the tech stack varies from developer to developer, the most popular stack is used in react boilerplate project code. It mainly uses Redux and redux-saga for state management and asynchronous side-effects, react-router for routing purpose, styled-components for styling react components, axios for invoking REST api, and other supported stack such as webpack, reselect, ESNext, Babel.
     You can clone the project https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate and start working on any new react project.

     Below are the main differences between Real DOM and Virtual DOM,

     | Real DOM                             | Virtual DOM                          |
     | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
     | Updates are slow                     | Updates are fast                     |
     | DOM manipulation is very expensive.  | DOM manipulation is very easy        |
     | You can update HTML directly.        | You Can’t directly update HTML       |
     | It causes too much of memory wastage | There is no memory wastage           |
     | Creates a new DOM if element updates | It updates the JSX if element update |

197.  ### How to add Bootstrap to a react application?

     Bootstrap can be added to your React app in a three possible ways,

     1. Using the Bootstrap CDN:
        This is the easiest way to add bootstrap. Add both bootstrap CSS and JS resources in a head tag.
     2. Bootstrap as Dependency:
        If you are using a build tool or a module bundler such as Webpack, then this is the preferred option for adding Bootstrap to your React application
        ```javascript
        npm install bootstrap
        ```
     3. React Bootstrap Package:
        In this case, you can add Bootstrap to our React app is by using a package that has rebuilt Bootstrap components to work particularly as React components. Below packages are popular in this category,
        1. react-bootstrap
        2. reactstrap

199.  ### Is it recommended to use CSS In JS technique in React?
     React does not have any opinion about how styles are defined but if you are a beginner then good starting point is to define your styles in a separate \*.css file as usual and refer to them using className. This functionality is not part of React but came from third-party libraries. But If you want to try a different approach(CSS-In-JS) then styled-components library is a good option.

201.  ### What is useEffect hook? How to fetch data with React Hooks?

     The `useEffect` hook is a React Hook that lets you perform **side effects** in function components. Side effects are operations that interact with the outside world or system and aren't directly related to rendering UI — such as fetching data, setting up subscriptions, timers, manually manipulating the DOM, etc.

     In function components, useEffect replaces the class component lifecycle methods(`componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate` and `componentWillUnmount`) with a single, unified API.

     **Syntax**
     ```js
     useEffect(() => {
        // Side effect logic here

        return () => {
        // Cleanup logic (optional)
        };
        }, [dependencies]);
     ```
     This effect hook can be used to fetch data from an API and to set the data in the local state of the component with the useState hook’s update function.

     Here is an example of fetching a list of ReactJS articles from an API using fetch.

     ```javascript
     import React from "react";

     function App() {
       const [data, setData] = React.useState({ hits: [] });

       React.useEffect(() => {
         fetch("http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=react")
           .then((response) => response.json())
           .then((data) => setData(data));
       }, []);

       return (
         <ul>
           {data.hits.map((item) => (
             <li key={item.objectID}>
               <a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>
             </li>
           ))}
         </ul>
       );
     }

     export default App;
     ```

     A popular way to simplify this is by using the library axios.

     We provided an empty array as second argument to the useEffect hook to avoid activating it on component updates. This way, it only fetches on component mount.

202.  ### Is Hooks cover all use cases for classes?
     Hooks doesn't cover all use cases of classes but there is a plan to add them soon. Currently there are no Hook equivalents to the uncommon **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate** and **componentDidCatch** lifecycles yet.

204.  ### Why do we use array destructuring (square brackets notation) in `useState`?

     When we declare a state variable with `useState`, it returns a pair — an array with two items. The first item is the current value, and the second is a function that updates the value. Using [0] and [1] to access them is a bit confusing because they have a specific meaning. This is why we use array destructuring instead.

     For example, the array index access would look as follows:

     ```javascript
     var userStateVariable = useState("userProfile"); // Returns an array pair
     var user = userStateVariable[0]; // Access first item
     var setUser = userStateVariable[1]; // Access second item
     ```

     Whereas with array destructuring the variables can be accessed as follows:

     ```javascript
     const [user, setUser] = useState("userProfile");
     ```

205.  ### What are the sources used for introducing hooks?

     Hooks got the ideas from several different sources. Below are some of them,

     1. Previous experiments with functional APIs in the react-future repository
     2. Community experiments with render prop APIs such as Reactions Component
     3. State variables and state cells in DisplayScript.
     4. Subscriptions in Rx.
     5. Reducer components in ReasonReact.

206.  ### How do you access imperative API of web components?
     Web Components often expose an imperative API to implement its functions. You will need to use a **ref** to interact with the DOM node directly if you want to access imperative API of a web component. But if you are using third-party Web Components, the best solution is to write a React component that behaves as a **wrapper** for your Web Component.

213.  ### Should I learn ES6 before learning ReactJS?

     No, you don’t have to learn es2015/es6 to learn react. But you may find many resources or React ecosystem uses ES6 extensively. Let's see some of the frequently used ES6 features,

     1. **Destructuring:** To get props and use them in a component

        ```javascript
        // in es 5
        var someData = this.props.someData;
        var dispatch = this.props.dispatch;

        // in es6
        const { someData, dispatch } = this.props;
        ```

     2. **Spread operator:** Helps in passing props down into a component

        ```javascript
        // in es 5
        <SomeComponent someData={this.props.someData} dispatch={this.props.dispatch} />

        // in es6
        <SomeComponent {...this.props} />
        ```

     3. **Arrow functions:** Makes compact syntax
        ```javascript
        // es 5
        var users = usersList.map(function (user) {
          return <li>{user.name}</li>;
        });
        // es 6
        const users = usersList.map((user) => <li>{user.name}</li>);
        ```

214.  ### What is Concurrent Rendering?

     The Concurrent rendering makes React apps to be more responsive by rendering component trees without blocking the main UI thread. It allows React to interrupt a long-running render to handle a high-priority event. i.e, When you enabled concurrent Mode, React will keep an eye on other tasks that need to be done, and if there's something with a higher priority it will pause what it is currently rendering and let the other task finish first. You can enable this in two ways,

     ```javascript
     // 1. Part of an app by wrapping with ConcurrentMode
     <React.unstable_ConcurrentMode>
       <Something />
     </React.unstable_ConcurrentMode>;

     // 2. Whole app using createRoot
     ReactDOM.unstable_createRoot(domNode).render(<App />);
     ```

215.  ### What is the difference between async mode and concurrent mode?
     Both refers the same thing. Previously concurrent Mode being referred to as "Async Mode" by React team. The name has been changed to highlight React’s ability to perform work on different priority levels. So it avoids the confusion from other approaches to Async Rendering.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

216.  ### Can I use javascript urls in react16.9?

     Yes, you can use javascript: URLs but it will log a warning in the console. Because URLs starting with javascript: are dangerous by including unsanitized output in a tag like `<a href>` and create a security hole.

     ```javascript
     const companyProfile = {
       website: "javascript: alert('Your website is hacked')",
     };
     // It will log a warning
     <a href={companyProfile.website}>More details</a>;
     ```

     Remember that the future versions will throw an error for javascript URLs.

217.  ### What is the purpose of eslint plugin for hooks?

     The ESLint plugin enforces rules of Hooks to avoid bugs. It assumes that any function starting with ”use” and a capital letter right after it is a Hook. In particular, the rule enforces that,

     1. Calls to Hooks are either inside a PascalCase function (assumed to be a component) or another useSomething function (assumed to be a custom Hook).
     2. Hooks are called in the same order on every render.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

218.  ### What is the difference between Imperative and Declarative in React?

     Imagine a simple UI component, such as a "Like" button. When you tap it, it turns blue if it was previously grey, and grey if it was previously blue.

     The imperative way of doing this would be:

     ```javascript
     if (user.likes()) {
       if (hasBlue()) {
         removeBlue();
         addGrey();
       } else {
         removeGrey();
         addBlue();
       }
     }
     ```

     Basically, you have to check what is currently on the screen and handle all the changes necessary to redraw it with the current state, including undoing the changes from the previous state. You can imagine how complex this could be in a real-world scenario.

     In contrast, the declarative approach would be:

     ```javascript
     if (this.state.liked) {
       return <blueLike />;
     } else {
       return <greyLike />;
     }
     ```

     Because the declarative approach separates concerns, this part of it only needs to handle how the UI should look in a specific state, and is therefore much simpler to understand.

219.  ### What are the benefits of using TypeScript with ReactJS?

     Below are some of the benefits of using TypeScript with ReactJS,

     1. It is possible to use latest JavaScript features
     2. Use of interfaces for complex type definitions
     3. IDEs such as VS Code was made for TypeScript
     4. Avoid bugs with the ease of readability and Validation

220.  ### How do you make sure that user remains authenticated on page refresh while using Context API State Management?

     When a user logs in and reload, to persist the state generally we add the load user action in the useEffect hooks in the main App.js. While using Redux, loadUser action can be easily accessed.

     **App.js**

     ```js
     import { loadUser } from "../actions/auth";
     store.dispatch(loadUser());
     ```

     - But while using **Context API**, to access context in App.js, wrap the AuthState in index.js so that App.js can access the auth context. Now whenever the page reloads, no matter what route you are on, the user will be authenticated as **loadUser** action will be triggered on each re-render.

     **index.js**

     ```js
     import React from "react";
     import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
     import App from "./App";
     import AuthState from "./context/auth/AuthState";

     ReactDOM.render(
       <React.StrictMode>
         <AuthState>
           <App />
         </AuthState>
       </React.StrictMode>,
       document.getElementById("root")
     );
     ```

     **App.js**

     ```js
     const authContext = useContext(AuthContext);

     const { loadUser } = authContext;

     useEffect(() => {
       loadUser();
     }, []);
     ```

     **loadUser**

     ```js
     const loadUser = async () => {
       const token = sessionStorage.getItem("token");

       if (!token) {
         dispatch({
           type: ERROR,
         });
       }
       setAuthToken(token);

       try {
         const res = await axios("/api/auth");

         dispatch({
           type: USER_LOADED,
           payload: res.data.data,
         });
       } catch (err) {
         console.error(err);
       }
     };
     ```

221.  ### What are the benefits of new JSX transform?

     There are three major benefits of new JSX transform,

     1. It is possible to use JSX without importing React packages
     2. The compiled output might improve the bundle size in a small amount
     3. The future improvements provides the flexibility to reduce the number of concepts to learn React.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

222.  ### How is the new JSX transform different from old transform??

     The new JSX transform doesn’t require React to be in scope. i.e, You don't need to import React package for simple scenarios.

     Let's take an example to look at the main differences between the old and the new transform,

     **Old Transform:**

     ```js
     import React from "react";

     function App() {
       return <h1>Good morning!!</h1>;
     }
     ```

     Now JSX transform convert the above code into regular JavaScript as below,

     ```js
     import React from "react";

     function App() {
       return React.createElement("h1", null, "Good morning!!");
     }
     ```

     **New Transform:**

     The new JSX transform doesn't require any React imports

     ```js
     function App() {
       return <h1>Good morning!!</h1>;
     }
     ```

     Under the hood JSX transform compiles to below code

     ```js
     import { jsx as _jsx } from "react/jsx-runtime";

     function App() {
       return _jsx("h1", { children: "Good morning!!" });
     }
     ```

     **Note:** You still need to import React to use Hooks.

223.  ### What are React Server components?

     React Server Component is a way to write React component that gets rendered in the server-side with the purpose of improving React app performance. These components allow us to load components from the backend.

     **Note:** React Server Components is still under development and not recommended for production yet.

224.  ### What is prop drilling?
     Prop Drilling is the process by which you pass data from one component of the React Component tree to another by going through other components that do not need the data but only help in passing it around.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

225.  ### What is the difference between useState and useRef hook?
     1. useState causes components to re-render after state updates whereas useRef doesn’t cause a component to re-render when the value or state changes.
        Essentially, useRef is like a “box” that can hold a mutable value in its (`.current`) property.
     2. useState allows us to update the state inside components. While useRef allows referencing DOM elements and tracking values.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

226.  ### What is a wrapper component?

     A wrapper in React is a component that wraps or surrounds another component or group of components. It can be used for a variety of purposes such as adding additional functionality, styling, or layout to the wrapped components.

     For example, consider a simple component that displays a message:

     ```javascript
     const Message = ({ text }) => {
       return <p>{text}</p>;
     };
     ```

     We can create a wrapper component that will add a border to the message component:

     ```javascript
     const MessageWrapper = (props) => {
       return (
         <div style={{ border: "1px solid black" }}>
           <Message {...props} />
         </div>
       );
     };
     ```

     Now we can use the MessageWrapper component instead of the Message component and the message will be displayed with a border:

     ```javascript
     <MessageWrapper text="Hello World" />
     ```

     Wrapper component can also accept its own props and pass them down to the wrapped component, for example, we can create a wrapper component that will add a title to the message component:

     ```javascript
     const MessageWrapperWithTitle = ({ title, ...props }) => {
       return (
         <div>
           <h3>{title}</h3>
           <Message {...props} />
         </div>
       );
     };
     ```

     Now we can use the MessageWrapperWithTitle component and pass title props:

     ```javascript
     <MessageWrapperWithTitle title="My Message" text="Hello World" />
     ```

     This way, the wrapper component can add additional functionality, styling, or layout to the wrapped component while keeping the wrapped component simple and reusable.

227.  ### What are the differences between useEffect and useLayoutEffect hooks?

     useEffect and useLayoutEffect are both React hooks that can be used to synchronize a component with an external system, such as a browser API or a third-party library. However, there are some key differences between the two:

     - Timing: useEffect runs after the browser has finished painting, while useLayoutEffect runs synchronously before the browser paints. This means that useLayoutEffect can be used to measure and update layout in a way that feels more synchronous to the user.

     - Browser Paint: useEffect allows browser to paint the changes before running the effect, hence it may cause some visual flicker. useLayoutEffect synchronously runs the effect before browser paints and hence it will avoid visual flicker.

     - Execution Order: The order in which multiple useEffect hooks are executed is determined by React and may not be predictable. However, the order in which multiple useLayoutEffect hooks are executed is determined by the order in which they were called.

     - Error handling: useEffect has a built-in mechanism for handling errors that occur during the execution of the effect, so that it does not crash the entire application. useLayoutEffect does not have this mechanism, and errors that occur during the execution of the effect will crash the entire application.

     In general, it's recommended to use useEffect as much as possible, because it is more performant and less prone to errors. useLayoutEffect should only be used when you need to measure or update layout, and you can't achieve the same result using useEffect.

228.  ### What are the differences between Functional and Class Components?

     There are two different ways to create components in ReactJS. The main differences are listed down as below,

     ## 1. Syntax:

     The class components uses ES6 classes to create the components. It uses `render` function to display the HTML content in the webpage.

     The syntax for class component looks like as below.

     ```js
     class App extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return <h1>This is a class component</h1>;
       }
     }
     ```

     **Note:** The **Pascal Case** is the recommended approach to provide naming to a component.

     Functional component has been improved over the years with some added features like Hooks. Here is a syntax for functional component.

     ```js
     function App() {
       return (
         <div className="App">
           <h1>Hello, I'm a function component</h1>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

     ## 2. State:

     State contains information or data about a component which may change over time.

     In class component, you can update the state when a user interacts with it or server updates the data using the `setState()` method. The initial state is going to be assigned in the `Constructor()` method using the `this.state` object and it is possible to assign different data types such as string, boolean, numbers, etc.

     **A simple example showing how we use the setState() and constructor():**

     ```js
     class App extends Component {
       constructor() {
         super();
         this.state = {
           message: "This is a class component",
         };
       }
       updateMessage() {
         this.setState({
           message: "Updating the class component",
         });
       }
       render() {
         return (
           <>
             <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
             <button
               onClick={() => {
                 this.updateMessage();
               }}>
               Click!!
             </button>
           </>
         );
       }
     }

     ```

     You didn't use state in functional components because it was only supported in class components. But over the years hooks have been implemented in functional components which enables to use state too.

     The `useState()` hook can used to implement state in functional components. It returns an array with two items: the first item is current state and the next one is a function (setState) that updates the value of the current state.

     Let's see an example to demonstrate the state in functional components,

     ```js
     function App() {
       const [message, setMessage] = useState("This is a functional component");
       const updateMessage = () => {
         setMessage("Updating the functional component");
       };
       return (
         <div className="App">
           <h1>{message} </h1>
           <button onClick={updateMessage}>Click me!!</button>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

     ## 3. Props:

     Props are referred to as "properties". The props are passed into React component just like arguments passed to a function. In other words, they are similar to HTML attributes.

     The props are accessible in child class component using `this.props` as shown in below example,

     ```js
     class Child extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return (
           <h1>
             {" "}
             This is a functional component and component name is {
               this.props.name
             }{" "}
           </h1>
         );
       }
     }

     class Parent extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return (
           <div className="Parent">
             <Child name="First child component" />
             <Child name="Second child component" />
           </div>
         );
       }
     }
     ```

     Props in functional components are similar to that of the class components but the difference is the absence of 'this' keyword.

     ```js
     function Child(props) {
       return (
         <h1>
           This is a child component and the component name is{props.name}
         </h1>
       );
     }

     function Parent() {
       return (
         <div className="Parent">
           <Child name="First child component" />
           <Child name="Second child component" />
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

229.  ### What is strict mode in React?

     `React.StrictMode` is a useful component for highlighting potential problems in an application. Just like `<Fragment>`, `<StrictMode>` does not render any extra DOM elements. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants. These checks apply for _development mode_ only.

     ```jsx harmony
     import { StrictMode } from "react";

     function App() {
       return (
         <div>
           <Header />
           <StrictMode>
             <div>
               <ComponentOne />
               <ComponentTwo />
             </div>
           </StrictMode>
           <Header />
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

     In the example above, the _strict mode_ checks apply to `<ComponentOne>` and `<ComponentTwo>` components only. i.e., Part of the application only.

     **Note:** Frameworks such as NextJS has this flag enabled by default.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

230.  ### What is the benefit of strict mode?

     The `<StrictMode>` will be helpful in the below cases,

     1. To find the bugs caused by impure rendering where the components will re-render twice.
     2. To find the bugs caused by missing cleanup of effects where the components will re-run effects one more extra time.
     3. Identifying components with **unsafe lifecycle methods**.
     4. Warning about **legacy string ref** API usage.
     5. Detecting unexpected **side effects**.
     6. Detecting **legacy context** API.
     7. Warning about deprecated **findDOMNode** usage

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

231.  ### Why does strict mode render twice in React?

     StrictMode renders components twice in development mode(not production) in order to detect any problems with your code and warn you about those problems. This is used to detect accidental side effects in the render phase. If you used `create-react-app` development tool then it automatically enables StrictMode by default.

     ```js
     const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
     root.render(
       <StrictMode>
         <App />
       </StrictMode>
     );
     ```

     If you want to disable this behavior then you can simply remove `strict` mode.

     ```js
     const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
     root.render(<App />);
     ```

     To detect side effects the following functions are invoked twice:

     1. Function component bodies, excluding the code inside event handlers.
     2. Functions passed to `useState`, `useMemo`, or `useReducer` (any other Hook)
     3. Class component's `constructor`, `render`, and `shouldComponentUpdate` methods
     4. Class component static `getDerivedStateFromProps` method
     5. State updater functions

232.  ### What are the rules of JSX?

     The below 3 rules needs to be followed while using JSX in a react application.

     1. **Return a single root element**:
        If you are returning multiple elements from a component, wrap them in a single parent element. Otherwise you will receive the below error in your browser console.

        `html Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag.`

     2. **All the tags needs to be closed:**
        Unlike HTML, all tags needs to closed explicitly with in JSX. This rule applies for self-closing tags(like hr, br and img tags) as well.
     3. **Use camelCase naming:**
        It is suggested to use camelCase naming for attributes in JSX. For example, the common attributes of HTML elements such as `class`, `tabindex` will be used as `className` and `tabIndex`.
        **Note:** There is an exception for `aria-*` and `data-*` attributes which should be lower cased all the time.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

233.  ### What is the reason behind multiple JSX tags to be wrapped?

      Behind the scenes, JSX is transformed into plain javascript objects. It is not possible to return two or more objects from a function without wrapping into an array. This is the reason you can't simply return two or more JSX tags from a function without
      wrapping them into a single parent tag or a Fragment.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

234.  ### How do you prevent mutating array variables?

      The preexisting variables outside of the function scope including state, props and context leads to a mutation and they result in unpredictable bugs during the rendering stage. The below points should be taken care while working with arrays variables.

      1. You need to take copy of the original array and perform array operations on it for the rendering purpose. This is called local mutation.
      2. Avoid triggering mutation methods such as push, pop, sort and reverse methods on original array. It is safe to use filter, map and slice method because they create a new array.

235.  ### What are capture phase events?

     The `onClickCapture` React event is helpful to catch all the events of child elements irrespective of event propagation logic or even if the events propagation stopped. This is useful if you need to log every click events for analytics purpose.

     For example, the below code triggers the click event of parent first followed by second level child eventhough leaf child button elements stops the propagation.

     ```jsx
     <div onClickCapture={() => alert("parent")}>
       <div onClickCapture={() => alert("child")}>
         <button onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()} />
         <button onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()} />
       </div>
     </div>
     ```

     The event propagation for the above code snippet happens in the following order:

     1. It travels downwards in the DOM tree by calling all `onClickCapture` event handlers.
     2. It executes `onClick` event handler on the target element.
     3. It travels upwards in the DOM tree by call all `onClick` event handlers above to it.

236.  ### How does React updates screen in an application?

     React updates UI in three steps,

     1. **Triggering or initiating a render:** The component is going to triggered for render in two ways.

        1. **Initial render:** When the app starts, you can trigger the initial render by calling `creatRoot` with the target DOM node followed by invoking component's `render` method. For example, the following code snippet renders `App` component on root DOM node.

        ```jsx
        import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

        const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
        root.render(<App />);
        ```

        2. **Re-render when the state updated:** When you update the component state using the state setter function, the componen't state automatically queues for a render.

     2. **Rendering components:** After triggering a render, React will call your components to display them on the screen. React will call the root component for initial render and call the function component whose state update triggered the render. This is a recursive process for all nested components of the target component.

     3. **Commit changes to DOM:** After calling components, React will modify the DOM for initial render using `appendChild()` DOM API and apply minimal necessary DOM updates for re-renders based on differences between rerenders.

237.  ### How does React batch multiple state updates?

      React prevents component from re-rendering for each and every state update by grouping multiple state updates within an event handler. This strategy improves the application performance and this process known as **batching**. The older version of React only supported batching for browser events whereas React18 supported for asynchronous actions, timeouts and intervals along with native events. This improved version of batching is called **automatic batching**.

      Let's demonstrate this automatic batching feature with a below example.

      ```jsx
      import { useState } from "react";

      export default function BatchingState() {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
        const [message, setMessage] = useState("batching");

        console.log("Application Rendered");

        const handleAsyncFetch = () => {
          fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1").then(() => {
            // Automatic Batching re-render only once
            setCount(count + 1);
            setMessage("users fetched");
          });
        };

        return (
          <>
            <h1>{count}</h1>
            <button onClick={handleAsyncFetch}>Click Me!</button>
          </>
        );
      }
      ```

      The preceding code updated two state variables with in an event handler. However, React will perform automatic batching feature and the component will be re-rendered only once for better performance.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

238.  ### Is it possible to prevent automatic batching?

      Yes, it is possible to prevent automatic batching default behavior. There might be cases where you need to re-render your component after each state update or updating one state depends on another state variable. Considering this situation, React introduced `flushSync` method from `react-dom` API for the usecases where you need to flush state updates to DOM immediately.

      The usage of `flushSync` method within an `onClick` event handler will be looking like as below,

      ```jsx
      import { flushSync } from "react-dom";

      const handleClick = () => {
        flushSync(() => {
          setClicked(!clicked); //Component will create a re-render here
        });

        setCount(count + 1); // Component will create a re-render again here
      };
      ```

      In the above click handler, React will update DOM at first using flushSync and second time updates DOM because of the counter setter function by avoiding automatic batching.

239.  ### What is React hydration?

      React hydration is used to add client-side JavaScript interactivity to pre-rendered static HTML generated by the server. It is used only for server-side rendering(SSR) to enhance the initial rendering time and make it SEO friendly application. This hydration acts as a bridge to reduce the gap between server side and client-side rendering.

      After the page loaded with generated static HTML, React will add application state and interactivity by attaching all event handlers for the respective elements. Let's demonstrate this with an example.

      Consider that React DOM API(using `renderToString`) generated HTML for `<App>` component which contains `<button>` element to increment the counter.

      ```jsx
      import {useState} from 'react';
      import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';

      export default function App() {
        const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

        return (
          <h1>Counter</h1>
          <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)}>
            {count} times
          </button>
          );
      }

      const html = renderToString(<App />);
      ```

      The above code generates the below HTML with a header text and button component without any interactivity.

      ```html
      <h1>Counter</h1>
      <button>
        <!-- -->0<!-- -->
        times
      </button>
      ```

      At this stage `hydrateRoot` API can be used to perform hydration by attaching `onClick` event handler.

      ```jsx
      import { hydrateRoot } from "react-dom/client";
      import App from "./App.js";

      hydrateRoot(document.getElementById("root"), <App />);
      ```

      After this step, you are able to run React application on server-side and hydrating the javascript bundle on client-side for smooth user experience and SEO purposes.

240.  ### How do you update objects inside state?

      You cannot update the objects which exists in the state directly. Instead, you should create a fresh new object (or copy from the existing object) and update the latest state using the newly created object. Eventhough JavaScript objects are mutable, you need to treat objects inside state as read-only while updating the state.

      Let's see this comparison with an example. The issue with regular object mutation approach can be described by updating the user details fields of `Profile` component. The properties of `Profile` component such as firstName, lastName and age details mutated in an event handler as shown below.

      ```jsx
      import { useState } from "react";

      export default function Profile() {
        const [user, setUser] = useState({
          firstName: "John",
          lastName: "Abraham",
          age: 30,
        });

        function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
          user.firstName = e.target.value;
        }

        function handleLastNameChange(e) {
          user.lastName = e.target.value;
        }

        function handleAgeChange(e) {
          user.age = e.target.value;
        }

        return (
          <>
            <label>
              First name:
              <input value={user.firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />
            </label>
            <label>
              Last name:
              <input value={user.lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />
            </label>
            <label>
              Age:
              <input value={user.age} onChange={handleAgeChange} />
            </label>
            <p>
              Profile:
              {person.firstName} {person.lastName} ({person.age})
            </p>
          </>
        );
      }
      ```

      Once you run the application with above user profile component, you can observe that user profile details won't be update upon entering the input fields.
      This issue can be fixed by creating a new copy of object which includes existing properties through spread syntax(...obj) and add changed values in a single event handler itself as shown below.

      ```jsx
      handleProfileChange(e) {
        setUser({
        ...user,
          [e.target.name]: e.target.value
        });
      }
      ```

      The above event handler is concise instead of maintaining separate event handler for each field. Now, UI displays the updated field values as expected without an issue.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

241.  ### How do you update nested objects inside state?

      You cannot simply use spread syntax for all kinds of objects inside state. Because spread syntax is shallow and it copies properties for one level deep only. If the object has nested object structure, UI doesn't work as expected with regular JavaScript nested property mutation. Let's demonstrate this behavior with an example of User object which has address nested object inside of it.

      ```jsx
      const user = {
        name: "John",
        age: 32,
        address: {
          country: "Singapore",
          postalCode: 440004,
        },
      };
      ```

      If you try to update the country nested field in a regular javascript fashion(as shown below) then user profile screen won't be updated with latest value.

      ```js
      user.address.country = "Germany";
      ```

      This issue can be fixed by flattening all the fields into a top-level object or create a new object for each nested object and point it to it's parent object. In this example, first you need to create copy of address object and update it with the latest value. Later, the address object should be linked to parent user object something like below.

      ```js
      setUser({
        ...user,
        address: {
          ...user.address,
          country: "Germany",
        },
      });
      ```

      This approach is bit verbose and not easy for deep hierarchical state updates. But this workaround can be used for few levels of nested objects without much hassle.

242.  ### How do you update arrays inside state?

      Eventhough arrays in JavaScript are mutable in nature, you need to treat them as immutable while storing them in a state. That means, similar to objects, the arrays cannot be updated directly inside state. Instead, you need to create a copy of the existing array and then set the state to use newly copied array.

      To ensure that arrays are not mutated, the mutation operations like direct direct assignment(arr[1]='one'), push, pop, shift, unshift, splice etc methods should be avoided on original array. Instead, you can create a copy of existing array with help of array operations such as filter, map, slice, spread syntax etc.

      For example, the below push operation doesn't add the new todo to the total todo's list in an event handler.

      ```jsx
      onClick = {
        todos.push({
          id: id+1,
          name: name
        })
      }
      ```

      This issue is fixed by replacing push operation with spread syntax where it will create a new array and the UI updated with new todo.

      ```jsx
      onClick = {
        [
          ...todos,
          { id: id+1, name: name }
        ]
      }
      ```

243.  ### How do you use immer library for state updates?

      Immer library enforces the immutability of state based on **copy-on-write** mechanism. It uses JavaScript proxy to keep track of updates to immutable states. Immer has 3 main states as below,

      1. **Current state:** It refers to actual state
      2. **Draft state:** All new changes will be applied to this state. In this state, draft is just a proxy of the current state.
      3. **Next state:** It is formed after all mutations applied to the draft state

      Immer can be used by following below instructions,

      1. Install the dependency using `npm install use-immer` command
      2. Replace `useState` hook with `useImmer` hook by importing at the top
      3. The setter function of `useImmer` hook can be used to update the state.

      For example, the mutation syntax of immer library simplifies the nested address object of user state as follows,

      ```jsx
      import { useImmer } from "use-immer";
      const [user, setUser] = useImmer({
        name: "John",
        age: 32,
        address: {
          country: "Singapore",
          postalCode: 440004,
        },
      });

      //Update user details upon any event
      setUser((draft) => {
        draft.address.country = "Germany";
      });
      ```

      The preceding code enables you to update nested objects with a conceise mutation syntax.

245.  ### What are the preferred and non-preferred array operations for updating the state?

      The below table represent preferred and non-preferred array operations for updating the component state.

      | Action    | Preferred            | Non-preferred              |
      | --------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
      | Adding    | concat, [...arr]     | push, unshift              |
      | Removing  | filter, slice        | pop, shift, splice         |
      | Replacing | map                  | splice, arr[i] = someValue |
      | sorting   | copying to new array | reverse, sort              |

      If you use Immer library then you can able to use all array methods without any problem.

248.  ### What are the guidelines to be followed for writing reducers?

     There are two guidelines to be taken care while writing reducers in your code.

     1. Reducers must be pure without mutating the state. That means, same input always returns the same output. These reducers run during rendering time similar to state updater functions. So these functions should not send any requests, schedule time outs and any other side effects.

     2. Each action should describe a single user interaction even though there are multiple changes applied to data. For example, if you "reset" registration form which has many user input fields managed by a reducer, it is suggested to send one "reset" action instead of creating separate action for each fields. The proper ordering of actions should reflect the user interactions in the browser and it helps a lot for debugging purpose.

249.  ### How does ReactJS work behind the scenes?
     ReactJS is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. While it appears simple on the surface, React performs a lot of complex operations behind the scenes to efficiently update the UI. Here's an overview of how it works internally:

     #### **1. Virtual DOM & Component Rendering**

     React doesn't manipulate the real DOM directly. Instead, it uses a **Virtual DOM** — a lightweight JavaScript representation of the UI.

     When a component renders (e.g., `<App />`):

        *   React **executes the component function** (e.g., `App()`).
        *   Hooks like `useState` are registered and tracked in order.
        *   React builds a **Virtual DOM tree** from the returned JSX.
        *   This virtual DOM is a **plain JS object** that describes the desired UI.

     This process ensures fast and efficient rendering before React decides how to update the real DOM.

     #### 2. **React Fiber Architecture**

     React’s core engine is called **Fiber**, introduced in React 16. Fiber is a reimplementation of the React reconciliation algorithm with the following capabilities:

        *   Breaks rendering work into **units of work** (fiber nodes).
        *   Enables **interruptible rendering** (important for responsiveness).
        *   Supports **priority scheduling** and **concurrent rendering**.

     Each Fiber node represents a component and stores:

        *   The component type (function/class).
        *   Props, state, and effects.
        *   Links to parent, child, and sibling fibers.

     #### 3. **Reconciliation (Diffing Algorithm)**

     When state or props change:

        *   React re-executes the component to produce a new virtual DOM.
        *   It **compares the new virtual DOM to the previous one** using an efficient diffing algorithm.
        *   React determines the **minimal set of DOM changes** required.

     This process is known as **reconciliation**.

     #### 4. **Commit Phase (Real DOM Updates)**

     Once reconciliation is done:

        *   React enters the **commit phase**.
        *   It applies calculated changes to the **real DOM**.
        *   It also runs side effects like `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect`.

     This is the only time React interacts directly with the browser DOM.

     #### 5. **Hooks and State Management**

     With Hooks (like `useState`, `useEffect`):

        *   React keeps an **internal list of hooks per component**.
        *   Hooks are identified by their order in the function.
        *   When state updates occur, React re-renders the component and re-runs the hooks in the same order.

     #### 6. **React Scheduler**

     React uses an internal **Scheduler** to control how updates are prioritized:

        *   Urgent tasks like clicks and inputs are processed immediately.
        *   Non-urgent tasks (like data fetching) can be delayed or paused.
        *   This improves responsiveness and allows for **time slicing** in Concurrent Mode.

250.  ### How is `useReducer` Different from `useState`?
     There are notable differences between `useState` and `useReducer` hooks.

        | Feature               | `useState`                           | `useReducer`                          |
        |-----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
        | State complexity      | Simple (one variable or flat object) | Complex, multi-part or deeply nested  |
        | Update style          | Direct (e.g. `setState(x)`)          | Through actions (e.g. `dispatch({})`) |
        | Update logic          | In component                         | In reducer function                   |
        | Reusability & testing | Less reusable                        | Highly reusable & testable            |

251.  ### What is useContext? What are the steps to follow for useContext?
     The `useContext` hook is a built-in React Hook that lets you access the value of a context inside a functional component without needing to wrap it in a `<Context.Consumer>` component.

     It helps you **avoid prop drilling** (passing props through multiple levels) by allowing components to access shared data like themes, authentication status, or user preferences.

     The usage of useContext involves three main steps:
      #### **Step 1 : Create the Context**

        Use `React.createContext()` to create a context object.

        ```jsx
        import React, { createContext } from 'react';

        const ThemeContext = createContext(); // default value optional
        ```

      You typically export this so other components can import it.

      #### **Step 2: Provide the Context Value**

        Wrap your component tree (or a part of it) with the `Context.Provider` and pass a `value` prop.

        ```jsx
        function App() {
            return (
                <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
                   <MyComponent />
                </ThemeContext.Provider>
            );
        }
        ```

        Now any component inside `<ThemeContext.Provider>` can access the context value.

        #### **Step 3: Consume the Context with** `**useContext**`

        In any functional component **inside the Provider**, use the `useContext` hook:

        ```jsx
        import { useContext } from 'react';
        function MyComponent() {
            const theme = useContext(ThemeContext); // theme = "dark"
            return <p>Current Theme: {theme}</p>;
        }
        ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

252.  ### What are the use cases of useContext hook?
     The `useContext` hook in React is used to share data across components without having to pass props manually through each level. Here are some common and effective use cases:

        1.  **Theme Customization**
            `useContext` can be used to manage application-wide themes, such as light and dark modes, ensuring consistent styling and enabling user-driven customization.
        2.  **Localization and Internationalization**
            It supports localization by providing translated strings or locale-specific content to components, adapting the application for users in different regions.
        3.  **User Authentication and Session Management**
            `useContext` allows global access to authentication status and user data. This enables conditional rendering of components and helps manage protected routes or user-specific UI elements.
        4.  **Shared Modal or Sidebar Visibility**
            It's ideal for managing the visibility of shared UI components like modals, drawers, or sidebars, especially when their state needs to be controlled from various parts of the app.
        5.  **Combining with** `**useReducer**` **for Global State Management**
            When combined with `useReducer`, `useContext` becomes a powerful tool for managing more complex global state logic. This pattern helps maintain cleaner, scalable state logic without introducing external libraries like Redux.
             Some of the common use cases of useContext are listed below,

253.  ### When to use client and server components?

      You can efficiently build nextjs application if you are aware about which part of the application needs to use client components and which other parts needs to use server components. The common cases of both client and server components are listed below:

        **Client components:**
        1. Whenever your need to add interactivity and event listeners such as onClick(), onChange(), etc to the pages
        2. If you need to use State and Lifecycle Effects like useState(), useReducer(), useEffect() etc.
        3. If there is a requirement to use browser-only APIs.
        4. If you need to implement custom hooks that depend on state, effects, or browser-only APIs.
        5. There are React Class components in the pages.

        **Server components:**
        1. If the component logic is about data fetching.
        2. If you need to access backend resources directly.
        3. When you need to keep sensitive information((access tokens, API keys, etc)	) on the server.
        4. If you want reduce client-side JavaScript and placing large dependencies on the server.

     Next.js provides two different routing systems: the **Page Router** (traditional) and the **App Router** (introduced in Next.js 13). The App Router is built on React Server Components and offers more powerful features for modern web applications.

     Here are the main differences between them:

     | Feature | Page Router | App Router |
     |---------|-------------|------------|
     | Directory | Uses `pages/` directory | Uses `app/` directory |
     | Routing | File-based routing with files like `pages/about.js` | File-based routing with folders and special files like `app/about/page.js` |
     | Components | All components are Client Components by default | All components are Server Components by default |
     | Layouts | Custom `_app.js` and `_document.js` for shared layouts | Native nested layouts using `layout.js` files |
     | Data Fetching | Uses `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, and `getInitialProps` | Uses `async/await` in Server Components with native `fetch` |
     | Loading States | Manual implementation required | Built-in `loading.js` for streaming and suspense |
     | Error Handling | Custom `_error.js` page | Built-in `error.js` for error boundaries at any level |
     | Streaming | Limited support | Built-in support for streaming with Suspense |
     | Server Actions | Not available | Native support for server-side mutations |
     | Metadata | Using `Head` component from `next/head` | Native Metadata API with `metadata` object or `generateMetadata` function |
     | Rendering | SSR, SSG, ISR, and CSR | SSR, SSG, ISR, CSR plus React Server Components |

     **Example of Page Router structure:**
     ```
     pages/
     ├── index.js          // Home page (/)
     ├── about.js          // About page (/about)
     ├── _app.js           // Custom App component
     ├── _document.js      // Custom Document
     └── posts/
         └── [id].js       // Dynamic route (/posts/:id)
     ```

     **Example of App Router structure:**
     ```
     app/
     ├── page.js           // Home page (/)
     ├── layout.js         // Root layout
     ├── loading.js        // Loading UI
     ├── error.js          // Error UI
     ├── about/
     │   └── page.js       // About page (/about)
     └── posts/
         └── [id]/
             └── page.js   // Dynamic route (/posts/:id)
     ```

     **Note:** The App Router is recommended for new Next.js applications as it provides better performance, simpler data fetching patterns, and improved developer experience with React Server Components.

255.  ### Can you describe the useMemo() Hook?

     The `useMemo()` Hook in React is used to **optimize performance** by **memoizing the result of expensive calculations**. It ensures that a function is **only re-executed when its dependencies change**, preventing unnecessary computations on every re-render.

     #### Syntax

     ```js
      const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(arg), [dependencies]);
     ```
      - **`computeExpensiveValue`**:
      A function that returns the computed result.

     - **`dependencies`**:
      An array of values that, when changed, will cause the memoized function to re-run.

      If the dependencies haven’t changed since the last render, React returns the **cached result** instead of re-running the function.

      Let's exaplain the usage of `useMemo` hook with an example of user search and its respective filtered users list.

      #### Example: Memoizing a Filtered List
      ```javascript
      import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

      const users = [
        { id: 1, name: 'Sudheer' },
        { id: 2, name: 'Brendon' },
        { id: 3, name: 'Charlie' },
        { id: 4, name: 'Dary' },
        { id: 5, name: 'Eden' }
      ];

      export default function UserSearch({ users }) {
        const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
        const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

        // Memoize the filtered user list based on the search term
        const filteredUsers = useMemo(() => {
          console.log("Filtering users...");
          return users.filter(user =>
            user.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
          );
        }, [searchTerm]);

        return (
          <div>
            <h2>Counter: {counter}</h2>
            <button onClick={() => setCounter(prev => prev + 1)}>Increment Counter</button>

            <h2>Search Users</h2>
            <input
              type="text"
              value={searchTerm}
              onChange={(e) => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}
              placeholder="Enter name"
            />

            <ul>
              {filteredUsers.map(user => (
                <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
              ))}
            </ul>
          </div>
        );
      }
      ```

      In the above example:
        - The filteredUsers list is only recomputed when searchTerm changes.
        - Pressing the "Increment Counter" button does not trigger the filtering logic again, as it's not a dependency.
        - The console will only log "Filtering users..." when the search term updates.

256.  ### Can Hooks be used in class components?
     No, Hooks cannot be used inside class components. They are specially designed for function components. This is because hooks depend on the sequence in which they are called during a component’s render, something that's only guaranteed in functional components. However, both class and function components can coexist in the same application.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

257.  ### What is an updater function? Should an updater function be used in all cases?
     An **updater function** is a form of `setState` where you pass a **function** instead of a direct value. This function receives the **previous state** as an argument and returns the **next state**.

     The updater function expression looks like below,
     ```js
     setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1); // Safe and predictable
     ```
     Here, `prevCount => prevCount + 1` is the updater function.

     In the React community, there's often a recommendation to use updater functions when updating state that depends on its previous value. This helps prevent unexpected behaviors that can arise from working with outdated or "stale" state.

     While using an updater function is a good habit, it's not always necessary. In most cases, React batches updates and ensures that the state is up-to-date at the beginning of the event handler, so you typically don’t run into stale state issues during a single synchronous event.
     However, if you’re doing multiple updates to the same state variable within a single handler, using the updater form ensures that each update correctly uses the latest state value, rather than a potentially outdated one.

     **Example: Multiple Updates in One Handler**
     ```js
     function handleCount() {
        setCounter(a => a + 1);
        setCounter(a => a + 1);
        setCounter(a => a + 1);
     }
     ```

     In this example, `a => a + 1` is an **updater function**. React queues these updater functions and applies them sequentially, each using the most recent state value. As a result, the counter will correctly increment by 3.

     In many cases, such as setting state based on user input or assigning static values, you don’t need the updater function:
     ```js
     setName('Sudheer');
     ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

258.  ### Can useState take a function as an initial value?
     Yes, `useState` can take a function as an initial value, and this is a useful feature in React called **lazy initialization**. This function is also known as **initializer function**.

     When you call useState(initialValue), you normally pass in a value directly:

     ```js
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  // initial value is 0
     ```

     But if calculating that initial value is expensive or involves logic, you can pass a function that returns the value:
     ```js
        const [count, setCount] = useState(() => {
        // This function only runs once — when the component first renders
        return expensiveComputation();
        });
     ```

     This function avoids doing heavy computation on every render. If you don't use this function form and invokes it directly, the function will run everytime the component renders and impact the performance.
     For example, the below usage is not recommended.
     ```js
     const [count, setCount] = useState(expensiveComputation());
     ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

259.  ### What types of values can `useState` hold?

     The `useState` hook accepts different types of values.

     *   Primitives: `number`, `string`, `boolean`
     *   Arrays
     *   Objects
     *   Functions
     *   `null` or `undefined`

     But you needs to be cautious with **reference types (objects/arrays)** because React compares old and new values **by reference**, so direct mutations won't trigger a re-render.
     For example, the correct and wrong ways of state updates as shown below,
     ```js
     user.name = "Sudheer"; //wrong way
     setUser(prev => ({ ...prev, name: 'Sudheer' })); //correct way
     ```
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

260.  ### What happens if you call `useState` conditionally?
     As per rules of React Hooks, hooks must be called unconditionally. For example, if you conditionally call it:
     ```js
     if (someCondition) {
        const [state, setState] = useState(0);
     }
     ```

     React will throw a runtime error because it **relies on the order of Hook calls**, and conditional logic breaks that order.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

261.  ### Is useState Synchronous or Asynchronous?
     The `useState` hook is synchronous, but state updates are asynchronous. When you call `useState()`, it runs synchronously and returns the state variable and setter function as tuple.
     ```js
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
     ```
     This happens immediately during rendering.
     However, the state update function (**setState**) is asynchronous in the sense that it doesn't update the state immediately.
     React **batches** updates and applies them before the next render. You won’t see the updated value immediately after calling `setState`.

     **Example:**
     ```js
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

     function handleClick() {
       setCount(count + 1);
       console.log(count); // ❗️Still logs the old value
     }
     ```
     The > `console.log(count)` prints the **old value**, because the update hasn’t happened yet.

     To see the updated state value, you can use `useEffect()` hook. It runs **after the component has re-rendered.**  By the time `useEffect` runs:

        *   The component has been updated.
        *   The **state contains the new value**.

        ```js
        import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

        function Counter() {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

        const handleClick = () => {
        setCount(count + 1);
        console.log('Clicked count (old):', count); // Old value
        };

        useEffect(() => {
        console.log('Updated count:', count); // New value
        }, [count]); // Only runs when `count` changes

        return <button onClick={handleClick}>Count: {count}</button>;
        }
        ```

262.  ### Can you explain how useState works internally?
      React’s hooks, including `useState`, rely on some internal machinery that keeps track of state **per component** and **per hook call** during rendering. Here's a simplified explanation of the internal mechanics:

      #### 1. **Hook List / Linked List**

      *   React maintains a linked list or array of "hook states" for each component.
      *   When a component renders, React keeps track of which hook it is currently processing via a cursor/index.
      *   Each call to `useState()` corresponds to one "slot" in this list.

      #### 2. **State Storage**

      *   Each slot stores:
        *   The current state value.
        *   A queue of pending state updates.

      #### 3. **Initial Render**

      *   When the component first renders, React:
         *   Creates a new slot for `useState` with the initial state (e.g., `0`).
         *   Returns `[state, updaterFunction]`.

      #### 4. **Updater Function**

      *   The updater function (`setCount`) is a closure that, when called:
        *   Enqueues a state update to React's internal queue.
        *   Schedules a re-render of the component.

      #### 5. **Re-render and State Update**

      *   On the next render:
        *   React processes all queued updates for each hook slot.
        *   Updates the stored state value accordingly.
        *   Returns the new state to the component.

      #### 6. **Important: Hook Order**

      *   Hooks must be called in the same order on every render so React can match hook calls to their internal slots.
      *   That’s why you can’t call hooks conditionally.

      The pseudocode for internal implementation of `useState` looks like below,
      ```js
        let hookIndex = 0;
        const hooks = [];

        function useState(initialValue) {
            const currentIndex = hookIndex;

            if (!hooks[currentIndex]) {
                // First render: initialize state
                hooks[currentIndex] = {
                    state: initialValue,
                    queue: [],
                };
            }

            const hook = hooks[currentIndex];

            // Process queued updates
            hook.queue.forEach(update => {
                hook.state = update(hook.state);
            });
            hook.queue = [];

            // Define updater function
            function setState(action) {
                // action can be new state or function(state) => new state
                hook.queue.push(typeof action === 'function' ? action : () => action);
                scheduleRender(); // triggers React re-render
            }

            hookIndex++;
            return [hook.state, setState];
        }
        ```

263.  ### What is `useReducer`? Why do you use useReducer?
     The `useReducer` hook is a React hook used to manage **complex state logic** inside **functional components**. It is conceptually similar to **Redux**. i.e, Instead of directly updating state like with `useState`, you **dispatch an action** to a **reducer function**, and the reducer returns the new state.

     The `useReducer` hook takes three arguments:

        ```js
        const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState, initFunction);
        ```

        *   `**reducer**`: A function `(state, action) => newState` that handles how state should change based on the action.
        *   `**initialState**`: The starting state.
        *   `**dispatch**`: A function you call to trigger an update by passing an action.

     The `useReducer` hook is used when:

     *   The **state is complex**, such as nested structures or multiple related values.
     *   State updates depend on the **previous state** and **logic**.
     *   You want to **separate state update logic** from UI code to make it cleaner and testable.
     *   You’re managing features like:
         *   Forms
         *   Wizards / Multi-step flows
         *   Undo/Redo functionality
         *   Shopping cart logic
         *   Toggle & conditional UI logic

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

264.  ### How does `useReducer` works? Explain with an example
     The `useReducer` hooks works similarly to Redux, where:

        *   You define a **reducer function** to handle state transitions.
        *   You dispatch actions to update the state.

     **Counter Example with Increment, Decrement, and Reset:**
     1. Reducer function:

        Define a counter reducer function that takes the current state and an action object with a type, and returns a new state based on that type.

         ```js
         function counterReducer(state, action) {
            switch (action.type) {
              case 'increment':
                return { count: state.count + 1 };
              case 'decrement':
                return { count: state.count - 1 };
              case 'reset':
                return { count: 0 };
              default:
                return state;
            }
          }
         ```
     2. Using `useReducer`:
      Invoke `useReducer` with above reducer function along with initial state. Thereafter, you can attach dispatch actions for respective button handlers.
      ```js
      import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

        function Counter() {
          const initialState = { count: 0 };
          const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, initialState);

          return (
            <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
              <h2>Count: {state.count}</h2>
              <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>Increment</button>
              <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>Decrement</button>
              <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'reset' })}>Reset</button>
            </div>
          );
        }

      export default Counter;
      ```
      Once the new state has been returned, React re-renders the component with the updated `state.count`.

265.  ### Can you combine **useReducer** with **useContext**?

      Yes, it's common to combine **useReducer** with **useContext** to build a lightweight state management system similar to Redux:

      ```js
      const AppContext = React.createContext();

      function AppProvider({ children }) {
        const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
        return (
          <AppContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
            {children}
          </AppContext.Provider>
        );
      }
      ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

266.  ### Can you dispatch multiple actions in a row with useReducer?
     Yes, you can dispatch multiple actions in a row using `useReducer` but not directly in one call. You'd have to call dispatch multiple times or create a composite action in your reducer that performs multiple updates based on the action type.

     **Example: Dispatching Multiple Actions**
     You can define a custom function with dispatching actions one by one.
     ```js
     function handleMultipleActions(dispatch) {
       dispatch({ type: 'increment' });
       dispatch({ type: 'increment' });
       dispatch({ type: 'reset' });
     }
     ```
     After that, you need to invoke it through event handler
     ```js
     <button onClick={() => handleMultipleActions(dispatch)}>
       Run Multiple Actions
     </button>
     ```
     **Note:** You can also define a custom action type If you want multiple state changes to be handled in one reducer call.
     ```js
     case 'increment_twice':
       return { count: state.count + 2 };
     ```
     Then dispatch
     ```js
     dispatch({ type: 'increment_twice' });
     ```

267.  ### How does useContext works? Explain with an example
     The `useContext` hook can be used for authentication state management across multiple components and pages in a React application.

     Let's build a simple authentication flow with:

        *   **Login and Logout buttons**
        *   Global `AuthContext` to share state
        *   Components that can **access and update** auth status

      **1. Create the Auth Context:**

       You can define `AuthProvider` which holds and provides `user`, `login()`, and `logout()` via context.
        ```js
        // AuthContext.js
        import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

        const AuthContext = createContext();

        export function AuthProvider({ children }) {
          const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

          const login = (username) => setUser({ name: username });
          const logout = () => setUser(null);

          return (
            <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, login, logout }}>
              {children}
            </AuthContext.Provider>
          );
        }

        // Custom hook for cleaner usage
        export const useAuth = () => useContext(AuthContext);
        ```
     **2. Wrap Your App with the Provider:**

        Wrap the above created provider in main `App.js` file
        ```js
        // App.js
        import React from 'react';
        import { AuthProvider } from './AuthContext';
        import HomePage from './HomePage';
        import Dashboard from './Dashboard';

        function App() {
          return (
            <AuthProvider>
              <HomePage />
              <Dashboard />
            </AuthProvider>
          );
        }

        export default App;
        ```
     **3. Home page with login:**
      Read or access user and login details through custom useAuth hook and use it inside home page.

        ```js
         // HomePage.js
         import React from 'react';
         import { useAuth } from './AuthContext';

         function HomePage() {
           const { user, login } = useAuth();

           return (
             <div>
               <h1>Home</h1>
               {user ? (
                 <p>Welcome back, {user.name}!</p>
               ) : (
                 <button onClick={() => login('Alice')}>Login</button>
               )}
             </div>
           );
         }

         export default HomePage;
        ```

     **4. Dashboard with logout:**
      Read or access user and logout details from `useAuth` custom hook and use it inside dashboard page.

      ```js
        // Dashboard.js
        import React from 'react';
        import { useAuth } from './AuthContext';

        function Dashboard() {
          const { user, logout } = useAuth();

          if (!user) {
            return <p>Please login to view the dashboard.</p>;
          }

          return (
            <div>
              <h2>Dashboard</h2>
              <p>Logged in as: {user.name}</p>
              <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
            </div>
          );
        }

        export default Dashboard;
      ```

268.  ### Can You Use Multiple Contexts in One Component?
     Yes, it is possible. You can use multiple contexts inside the same component by calling useContext multiple times, once for each context.

     It can be achieved with below steps,

        *   Create multiple contexts using `createContext()`.
        *   Wrap your component tree with multiple `<Provider>`s.
        *   Call `useContext()` separately for each context in the same component.

     **Example: Using `ThemeContext` and `UserContext` Together**
     ```js
     import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

      // Step 1: Create two contexts
      const ThemeContext = createContext();
      const UserContext = createContext();

      function Dashboard() {
        // Step 2: Use both contexts
        const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
        const user = useContext(UserContext);

        return (
          <div style={{ background: theme === 'dark' ? '#333' : '#fff' }}>
            <h1>Welcome, {user.name}</h1>
            <p>Current theme: {theme}</p>
          </div>
        );
      }

      // Step 3: Provide both contexts
      function App() {
        return (
          <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
            <UserContext.Provider value={{ name: 'Sudheer' }}>
              <Dashboard />
            </UserContext.Provider>
          </ThemeContext.Provider>
        );
      }

      export default App;
     ```

269.  ### What's a common pitfall when using useContext with objects?
     A **common pitfall** when using `useContext` with objects is **triggering unnecessary re-renders** across all consuming components — even when only part of the context value changes.

     When you provide an object as the context value, React compares the entire object reference. If the object changes (even slightly), React assumes the whole context has changed, and **all components using** `useContext(MyContext)` **will re-render**, regardless of whether they use the part that changed.

     **Example:**
     ```js
        const MyContext = React.createContext();

        function MyProvider({ children }) {
          const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
          const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');

          // This causes all consumers to re-render on any state change
          const contextValue = { user, setUser, theme, setTheme };

          return (
            <MyContext.Provider value={contextValue}>
              {children}
            </MyContext.Provider>
          );
        }
     ```
     In this case, a change in `theme` will also trigger a re-render in components that only care about `user`.

     This issue can be fixed in two ways,

     **1. Split Contexts**
     Create separate contexts for unrelated pieces of state:

     ```jsx
     const UserContext = React.createContext();
     const ThemeContext = React.createContext();
     ```

     **2. Memoize Context Value**
     Use `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders:

     ```jsx
       const contextValue = useMemo(() => ({ user, setUser, theme, setTheme }), [user, theme]);
     ```

     However, this only helps if the object structure and dependencies are well controlled.

  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

270.  ### What would the context value be for no matching provider?

     When a component calls `useContext(SomeContext)` but **no matching** `<SomeContext.Provider>` **is present higher up in the component tree**, the **default value** passed to `React.createContext(defaultValue)` is returned.

     ```js
     const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light'); // 'light' is the default value

     function ThemedComponent() {
       const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
       return <div>Current theme: {theme}</div>;
     }

     // No ThemeContext.Provider anywhere in the tree
     ```
     In this case, `theme` will be 'light'. It's the default value you provided when you created the context.

     **Note:** If you don’t specify a default value, the context value will be undefined when used without a provider:

     ```jsx
     const AuthContext = React.createContext(); // No default

     function Profile() {
       const auth = useContext(AuthContext);
       // auth will be undefined if there's no AuthContext.Provider
     }
     ```

271.  ### How do reactive dependencies in the useEffect dependency array affect its execution behavior?
     The `useEffect` hook accepts an optional dependencies argument that accepts an array of reactive values. The **dependency array** determines **when** the effect runs. i.e, It makes `useEffect` _reactive_ to changes in specified values.

     #### **How Dependency Array Affects Behavior**

     1. **Empty Dependency Array:** `**[]**`

     ```css
     useEffect(() => {
       // runs once after the initial render
     }, []);
     ```

      *   Effect runs **only once** (like `componentDidMount`).
      *   Ignores all state/prop changes.

     2. **With Specific Dependencies:** `**[count, user]**`

     ```css
     useEffect(() => {
       // runs after initial render
       // AND whenever `count` or `user` changes
     }, [count, user]);
     ```

       *   Effect runs on **first render**, and
       *   Again **every time** any dependency value changes.

     3. **No Dependency Array (Omitted)**

          ```css
          useEffect(() => {
            // runs after **every** render
          });
          ```

           *   Effect runs after **every render**, regardless of what changed.
           *   Can lead to **performance issues** if not used carefully.

       React uses shallow comparison of the dependencies. If any value has changed (!==), the effect will re-run.

       **Note:** This hook works well when dependencies are primitives or memoized objects/functions.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

272.  ### When and how often does React invoke the setup and cleanup functions inside a useEffect hook?

     1. **Setup Function Execution (`useEffect`)**

         The setup function (or the main function) you pass to `useEffect` runs at specific points:

           1.  **After the component is mounted** (if the dependency array is empty `[]`)
           2.  **After every render** (if no dependency array is provided)
           3.  **After a dependency value changes** (if the dependency array contains variables)

     2. **Cleanup Function Execution (Returned function from `useEffect`)**

        The cleanup function is called **before the effect is re-executed** and when the component **unmounts**.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

273.  ### What happens if you return a Promise from useEffect??
      You should NOT return a Promise from useEffect. React expects the function passed to useEffect to return either nothing (undefined) or a cleanup function (synchronous function). i.e, It does not expect or handle a returned Promise. If you still return a Promise, React will ignore it silently, and it may lead to bugs or warnings in strict mode.

      **Incorrect:**
      ```js
      useEffect(async () => {
        await fetchData(); // ❌ useEffect shouldn't be async
      }, []);
      ```
      **Correct:**
      ```jsx
      useEffect(() => {
        const fetchData = async () => {
          const res = await fetch('/api');
          const data = await res.json();
          setData(data);
        };

        fetchData();
      }, []);
      ```
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

274.  ### Can you have multiple useEffect hooks in a single component?
      Yes, multiple useEffect hooks are allowed and recommended when you want to separate concerns.

      ```jsx
      useEffect(() => {
        // Handles API fetch
      }, []);

      useEffect(() => {
        // Handles event listeners
      }, []);
      ```
      Each effect runs independently and helps make code modular and easier to debug.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

275.  ### How to prevent infinite loops with useEffect?
        Infinite loops happen when the effect updates state that’s listed in its own dependency array, which causes the effect to re-run, updating state again and so on.

        **Infinite loop scenario:**
        ```js
        useEffect(() => {
          setCount(count + 1);
        }, [count]); // Triggers again every time count updates
        ```
        You need to ensure that setState calls do not depend on values that cause the effect to rerun, or isolate them with a guard.
        ```js
        useEffect(() => {
          if (count < 5) {
            setCount(count + 1);
          }
        }, [count]);
        ```
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

276.  ### What are the usecases of useLayoutEffect?
      You need to use `useLayoutEffect` when your effect **must run before the browser paints**, such as:

      *   **Reading layout measurements** (e.g., element size, scroll position)
      *   **Synchronously applying DOM styles** to prevent visual flicker
      *   **Animating layout or transitions**
      *   **Integrating with third-party libraries** that require DOM manipulation

      If there's no visual or layout dependency, prefer `useEffect` — it's more performance-friendly.

      ```js
      useLayoutEffect(() => {
        const width = divRef.current.offsetWidth;
        if (width < 400) {
          divRef.current.style.background = 'blue'; // prevents flicker
        }
      }, []);
      ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

277.  ### How does useLayoutEffect work during server-side rendering (SSR)?

     The `useLayoutEffect` hook does **not run on the server**, because there is no DOM. React issues a warning in server environments like Next.js if `useLayoutEffect` is used directly.

     This can be mitigated using a conditional polyfill:

      ```jsx
      const useIsomorphicLayoutEffect =
        typeof window !== 'undefined' ? useLayoutEffect : useEffect;
      ```

      i.e, Use `useIsomorphicLayoutEffect` in components that render both on client and server.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

278.  ### What happens if you use useLayoutEffect for non-layout logic?
      Using `useLayoutEffect` for logic **unrelated to layout or visual DOM changes** (such as logging, data fetching, or analytics) is **not recommended**. It can lead to **performance issues** or even unexpected behavior.

      **Example: Anti-pattern**
      ```js
      useLayoutEffect(() => {
        console.log("Tracking analytics");
        fetch('/log-page-view');
      }, []);
      ```
      The above usage delays the paint of the UI just to send a network request, which could (and should) be done after paint using useEffect.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

279.  ### How does useLayoutEffect cause layout thrashing?
      The `useLayoutEffect` can **cause layout thrashing** when you **repeatedly read and write to the DOM** in ways that force the browser to recalculate layout multiple times per frame. This is because `useLayoutEffect` runs _before the browser paints_, these reflows happen _synchronously_, blocking rendering and degrading performance.

      **Example:**
      ```js
      function ThrashingComponent() {
        const ref = useRef();

        useLayoutEffect(() => {
          const height = ref.current.offsetHeight; //Read
          ref.current.style.height = height + 20 + 'px'; //Write
          const newHeight = ref.current.offsetHeight; //Read again — forces reflow
        }, []);

        return <div ref={ref}>Hello</div>;
      }
      ```
      In the above code, each read/write cycle triggers synchronous reflows, blocking the main thread and delays UI rendering.

      This issue can be avoided by batching your DOM reads and writes and prevent unnecessary reads after writes.

280.  ### How Do You Use useRef to Access a DOM Element in React? Give an example.
        The `useRef` hook is commonly used in React to directly reference and interact with DOM elements — like focusing an input, scrolling to a section, or controlling media elements.

        When you assign a ref to a DOM element using useRef, React gives you access to the underlying DOM node via the .current property of the ref object.

        **Example: Focus an input**

        ```js
        import React, { useRef } from 'react';

        function FocusInput() {
          const inputRef = useRef(null); // create the ref

          const handleFocus = () => {
            inputRef.current.focus(); // access DOM element and focus it
          };

          return (
            <div>
              <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
              <button onClick={handleFocus}>Focus the input</button>
            </div>
          );
        }
        ```
       **Note:** The DOM reference is only available **after the component has mounted** — typically accessed in `useEffect` or event handlers.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

281.  ### Can you use useRef to persist values across renders??
        Yes, you can use `useRef` to persist values across renders in React. Unlike `useState`, changing `.current` does not cause re-renders, but the value is preserved across renders.

        **Example:**
        ```js
        function Timer() {
          const renderCount = useRef(0);
          useEffect(() => {
            renderCount.current++;
            console.log("Render count:", renderCount.current);
          });

          return <div>Check console for render count.</div>;
        }
        ```
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

282.  ### Can useRef be used to store previous values?
        Yes, `useRef` is a common pattern when you want to compare current and previous props or state without causing re-renders.

        **Example: Storing previous state value**
        ```js
        import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

        function PreviousValueExample() {
          const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
          const prevCountRef = useRef();

          useEffect(() => {
            prevCountRef.current = count;
          }, [count]);

          const prevCount = prevCountRef.current;

          return (
            <div>
              <p>Current: {count}</p>
              <p>Previous: {prevCount}</p>
              <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>Increment</button>
            </div>
          );
        }
        ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

283.  ### Is it possible to access a ref in the render method?
        Yes, you can access a ref in the render method, but what you get from it depends on how you're using the ref and when in the component lifecycle you're rendering.

        For example, when using ref to access a DOM node (e.g., divRef.current), it's not immediately available on the first render.
        ```js
        const divRef = useRef(null);

        console.log(divRef.current); // ❌ null on initial render
        return <div ref={divRef}>Hello</div>;
        ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

284.  ### What are the common usecases of useRef hook?
      Some of the common cases are:
      *   Automatically focus an input when a component mounts.
      *   Scroll to a specific element.
      *   Measure element dimensions (`offsetWidth`, `clientHeight`).
      *   Control video/audio playback.
      *   Integrate with non-React libraries (like D3 or jQuery).

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

285.  ### What is useImperativeHandle Hook? Give an example.
      `useImperativeHandle` is a React Hook that allows a **child component** to expose **custom functions or properties** to its **parent component**, when using `ref`.
      It is typically used with `forwardRef` and is very useful in cases like **modals**, **dialogs**, **custom inputs**, etc., where the parent needs to **control behavior imperatively** (e.g., open, close, reset).

      **Example: Dialog component**
      ```js
      import React, {
        useRef,
        useState,
        useImperativeHandle,
        forwardRef,
      } from 'react';
      import './Dialog.css';

      const Dialog = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
        const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
        const [formData, setFormData] = useState('');

        useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
          open: () => setIsOpen(true),
          close: () => setIsOpen(false),
          reset: () => setFormData(''),
        }));

        if (!isOpen) return null;

        return (
          <div className="dialog">
            <h2>Dialog</h2>
            <input
              type="text"
              value={formData}
              placeholder="Type something..."
              onChange={(e) => setFormData(e.target.value)}
            />
            <br />
            <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(false)}>Close</button>
          </div>
        );
      });

      function Parent() {
        const dialogRef = useRef();

        return (
          <div>
            <h1>useImperativeHandle Dialog Example</h1>
            <button onClick={() => dialogRef.current.open()}>Open Dialog</button>
            <button onClick={() => dialogRef.current.reset()}>Reset Dialog</button>
            <button onClick={() => dialogRef.current.close()}>Close Dialog</button>

            <Dialog ref={dialogRef} />
          </div>
        );
      }

      export default Parent;
      ```

350.  ### When should you use useImperativeHandle?
      The useImperativeHandler hook will be used in below cases:

      *   You want to expose **imperative methods** from a child component
            - Custom input controls exposing `focus`, `clear`, or `validate` methods
            - Modal components exposing `open()` and `close()` methods
            - Scroll containers exposing `scrollToTop()` or `scrollToBottom()` methods
      *   You want to **hide internal implementation** but provide controlled external access.
      *   You're building **reusable component libraries** (e.g., inputs, modals, form controls).

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

351.  ### Is that possible to use useImperativeHandle without forwardRef?
        **No.** `useImperativeHandle` only works when the component is wrapped in `forwardRef`. It's the combination that allows parent components to use a `ref` on a function component.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

352.  ### How is useMemo different from useCallback?
     The following table compares both useMemo and useCallback:

      | Feature | `useMemo` | `useCallback` |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | **Purpose** | Memoizes the **result of a computation** | Memoizes a **function reference** |
      | **Returns** | A **value** (e.g., result of a function) | A **function** |
      | **Usage** | `useMemo(() => computeValue(), [deps])` | `useCallback(() => doSomething(), [deps])` |
      | **Primary Use Case** | Avoid expensive recalculations | Prevent unnecessary re-creations of functions |
      | **Common Scenario** | Filtering, sorting, calculating derived data | Passing callbacks to child components |
      | **When It's Useful** | When the value is expensive to compute | When referential equality matters (e.g., props) |
      | **Recomputed When** | Dependencies change | Dependencies change |
      | **Returned Value Type** | Any (number, object, array, etc.) | Always a function |
      | **Overhead** | Slight (evaluates a function and caches result) | Slight (caches a function reference) |

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

353.  ### Does useMemo prevent re-rendering of child components?

        The `useMemo` hook **does not directly prevent re-rendering of child components**. Its main purpose is to memoize the result of an expensive computation so that it doesn’t get recalculated unless its dependencies change. While this can improve performance, it doesn’t inherently control whether a child component re-renders.

        However, `useMemo` **can help prevent re-renders** when the memoized value is passed as a prop to a child component that is wrapped in `React.memo`. In that case, if the memoized value doesn’t change between renders (i.e., it has the same reference), React.memo can skip re-rendering the child. So, while `useMemo` doesn’t stop renders on its own, it **works in combination** with tools like `React.memo` to optimize rendering behavior.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

354.  ### What is `useCallback` and why is it used?

        The `useCallback` is a React Hook used to memoize **function definitions** between renders. It returns the same function reference unless its dependencies change. This is especially useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components (e.g. those wrapped in `React.memo`) to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

        **Example:**

        ```css
        const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
          console.log('Button clicked');
        }, []);
        ```

        Without `useCallback`, a new function is created on every render, potentially causing child components to re-render unnecessarily.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

355.  ### What are Custom React Hooks, and How Can You Develop One?

      **Custom Hooks** in React are JavaScript functions that allow you to **extract and reuse component logic** using React’s built-in Hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.

      They start with the word **"use"** and let you encapsulate logic that multiple components might share—such as fetching data, handling forms, or managing timers—without repeating code.

      Let's explain the custom hook usage with `useFetchData` example. The `useFetchData` custom Hook is a reusable function in React that simplifies the process of fetching data from an API. It encapsulates common logic such as initiating the fetch request, managing loading and error states, and storing the fetched data. By using built-in Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`, `useFetchData` provides a clean interface that returns the `data`, `loading`, and `error` values, which can be directly used in components.

      ```jsx
      import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

      function useFetchData(url) {
        const [data, setData] = useState(null);     // Holds the response
        const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true); // Loading state
        const [error, setError] = useState(null);     // Error state

        useEffect(() => {
          let isMounted = true; // Prevent setting state on unmounted component
          setLoading(true);

          fetch(url)
            .then((response) => {
              if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
              return response.json();
            })
            .then((json) => {
              if (isMounted) {
                setData(json);
                setLoading(false);
              }
            })
            .catch((err) => {
              if (isMounted) {
                setError(err.message);
                setLoading(false);
              }
            });

          return () => {
            isMounted = false; // Clean-up function to avoid memory leaks
          };
        }, [url]);

        return { data, loading, error };
      }
      ```

      The above custom hook can be used to retrieve users data for `AuthorList`, `ReviewerList` components.

      **Example: AuthorList component**
      ```jsx
      function AuthorList() {
        const { data, loading, error } = useFetchData('https://api.example.com/authors');

        if (loading) return <p>Loading authors...</p>;
        if (error) return <p>Error: {error}</p>;

        return (
          <ul>
            {data.map((author) => (
              <li key={author.id}>{author.name}</li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        );
      }
      ```

      Some of the benefits of custom hooks are:
       *   Promotes **code reuse**
       *   Keeps components **clean and focused**
       *   Makes complex logic **easier to test and maintain**

356.  ### How does React Fiber works? Explain in detail.

      React Fiber is the **core engine** that enables advanced features like **concurrent rendering**, **prioritization**, and **interruptibility** in React. Here's how it works:

      ### 1. **Fiber Tree Structure**

      Each component in your app is represented by a **Fiber node** in a tree structure. A Fiber node contains:
      *   Component type
      *   Props & state
      *   Pointers to parent, child, and sibling nodes
      *   Effect tags to track changes (e.g., update, placement)
      *   This forms the **Fiber Tree**, a data structure React uses instead of the traditional call stack.

      ### 2. **Two Phases of Rendering**

        #### **A. Render Phase (work-in-progress)**

      *   React builds a **work-in-progress Fiber tree**.
      *   It walks through each component (begin phase), calculates what needs to change, and collects side effects (complete phase).
      *   This phase is **interruptible**—React can pause it and resume later.
        #### **B. Commit Phase**

      *   React applies changes to the **Real DOM**.
      *   Runs lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`, `useEffect`).
      *   This phase is **non-interruptible** but fast.

        ### 3. **Work Units and Scheduling**

      *   React breaks rendering into **units of work** (small tasks).
      *   These units are scheduled based on **priority** using the **React Scheduler**.
      *   If time runs out (e.g., user starts typing), React can **pause and yield** control back to the browser.

        ### 4. **Double Buffering with Two Trees**

      *   React maintains two trees:
      *   **Current Tree** – what's visible on the screen.
      *   **Work-In-Progress Tree** – the next version being built in memory.
      *   Only after the new tree is fully ready, React **commits** it, making it the new current tree.

        ### 5. **Concurrency and Prioritization**

      *   React can prepare multiple versions of UI at once (e.g., during slow data loading).
      *   Updates can be **assigned priorities**, so urgent updates (like clicks) are handled faster than background work.

357.  ### What is the useId hook and when should you use it?

     The `useId` hook is a React hook introduced in React 18 that generates **unique IDs** that are stable across server and client renders. It's primarily used for **accessibility attributes** like linking form labels to inputs.

     #### Syntax
     ```js
     const id = useId();
     ```

     #### Example: Accessible Form Input
     ```jsx
     import { useId } from 'react';

     function EmailField() {
       const id = useId();

       return (
         <div>
           <label htmlFor={id}>Email:</label>
           <input id={id} type="email" />
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

     #### When to Use
     - Generating unique IDs for form elements (`htmlFor`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-labelledby`)
     - Creating stable IDs in server-side rendering (SSR) applications
     - Avoiding ID collisions when the same component is rendered multiple times

     #### When NOT to Use
     - As keys in a list (use data-based keys instead)
     - As CSS selectors or query selectors
     - For any purpose that requires the ID to be predictable

     **Note:** The IDs generated by `useId` contain colons (`:`) which may not work in CSS selectors. For multiple related IDs, you can use the same `id` as a prefix: `${id}-firstName`, `${id}-lastName`.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

358.  ### What is the useDeferredValue hook?

     The `useDeferredValue` hook is used to **defer updating a part of the UI** to keep other parts responsive. It accepts a value and returns a "deferred" version of that value that may lag behind. This is useful for optimizing performance when rendering expensive components.

     #### Syntax
     ```js
     const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value);
     ```

     #### Example: Search with Deferred Results
     ```jsx
     import { useState, useDeferredValue, useMemo } from 'react';

     function SearchResults({ query }) {
       // Expensive computation or large list filtering
       const results = useMemo(() => {
         return largeDataSet.filter(item =>
           item.name.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
         );
       }, [query]);

       return (
         <ul>
           {results.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
         </ul>
       );
     }

     function SearchPage() {
       const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
       const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);
       const isStale = query !== deferredQuery;

       return (
         <div>
           <input
             value={query}
             onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}
             placeholder="Search..."
           />
           <div style={{ opacity: isStale ? 0.5 : 1 }}>
             <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />
           </div>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

     The input stays responsive while the expensive `SearchResults` component re-renders with a slight delay using the deferred value.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

359.  ### What is the useTransition hook and how does it differ from useDeferredValue?

     The `useTransition` hook allows you to mark certain state updates as **non-urgent transitions**, keeping the UI responsive during expensive re-renders. It returns a `isPending` flag and a `startTransition` function.

     #### Syntax
     ```js
     const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
     ```

     #### Example: Tab Switching
     ```jsx
     import { useState, useTransition } from 'react';

     function TabContainer() {
       const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
       const [tab, setTab] = useState('home');

       function selectTab(nextTab) {
         startTransition(() => {
           setTab(nextTab);
         });
       }

       return (
         <div>
           <button onClick={() => selectTab('home')}>Home</button>
           <button onClick={() => selectTab('posts')}>Posts (slow)</button>
           <button onClick={() => selectTab('contact')}>Contact</button>

           {isPending && <Spinner />}

           {tab === 'home' && <HomeTab />}
           {tab === 'posts' && <PostsTab />}  {/* Expensive component */}
           {tab === 'contact' && <ContactTab />}
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

     #### Differences from useDeferredValue

     | Feature | useTransition | useDeferredValue |
     |---------|--------------|------------------|
     | Controls | State updates (wraps `setState`) | Values (wraps a value) |
     | Use case | When you control the state update | When you receive a value from props or other hooks |
     | Returns | `[isPending, startTransition]` | Deferred value |
     | Pending state | Built-in `isPending` flag | Manual comparison needed |

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

286.  ### What is the useSyncExternalStore hook?

     The `useSyncExternalStore` hook is designed to **subscribe to external stores** (non-React state sources) in a way that's compatible with concurrent rendering. It's primarily used by library authors for state management libraries.

     #### Syntax
     ```js
     const state = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot, getServerSnapshot?);
     ```

     - **subscribe**: Function to subscribe to the store, returns an unsubscribe function
     - **getSnapshot**: Function that returns the current store value
     - **getServerSnapshot**: Optional function for SSR that returns the initial server snapshot

     #### Example: Browser Online Status
     ```jsx
     import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';

     function getSnapshot() {
       return navigator.onLine;
     }

     function subscribe(callback) {
       window.addEventListener('online', callback);
       window.addEventListener('offline', callback);
       return () => {
         window.removeEventListener('online', callback);
         window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);
       };
     }

     function useOnlineStatus() {
       return useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot, () => true);
     }

     function StatusBar() {
       const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
       return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;
     }
     ```

     This hook ensures that when the external store changes, React re-renders consistently without tearing (showing inconsistent data).

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

287.  ### What is the useInsertionEffect hook?

     The `useInsertionEffect` hook is designed for **CSS-in-JS library authors** to inject styles into the DOM before any layout effects run. It fires synchronously before DOM mutations.

     #### Syntax
     ```js
     useInsertionEffect(() => {
       // Insert styles here
       return () => {
         // Cleanup
       };
     }, [dependencies]);
     ```

     #### Execution Order
     ```
     1. useInsertionEffect  → Inject styles
     2. DOM mutations       → React updates DOM
     3. useLayoutEffect     → Read layout, synchronously re-render if needed
     4. Browser paint       → User sees the result
     5. useEffect           → Side effects run
     ```

     #### Example: Dynamic Style Injection
     ```jsx
     import { useInsertionEffect } from 'react';

     let isInserted = new Set();

     function useCSS(rule) {
       useInsertionEffect(() => {
         if (!isInserted.has(rule)) {
           isInserted.add(rule);
           const style = document.createElement('style');
           style.textContent = rule;
           document.head.appendChild(style);
         }
       }, [rule]);
     }

     function Button() {
       useCSS('.dynamic-btn { background: blue; color: white; }');
       return <button className="dynamic-btn">Click me</button>;
     }
     ```

     **Note:** This hook is not intended for application code. It's specifically for CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or Emotion to prevent style flickering.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

288.  ### How do you share state logic between components using custom hooks?

     Custom hooks allow you to **extract and share stateful logic** between components without changing their hierarchy. The state itself is not shared—each component using the hook gets its own isolated state.

     #### Example: useLocalStorage Hook
     ```jsx
     import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

     function useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {
       // Get stored value or use initial value
       const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState(() => {
         try {
           const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
           return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
         } catch (error) {
           console.error(error);
           return initialValue;
         }
       });

       // Update localStorage when state changes
       useEffect(() => {
         try {
           window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(storedValue));
         } catch (error) {
           console.error(error);
         }
       }, [key, storedValue]);

       return [storedValue, setStoredValue];
     }

     // Usage in multiple components
     function ThemeToggle() {
       const [theme, setTheme] = useLocalStorage('theme', 'light');
       return (
         <button onClick={() => setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light')}>
           Current: {theme}
         </button>
       );
     }

     function FontSizeSelector() {
       const [fontSize, setFontSize] = useLocalStorage('fontSize', 16);
       return (
         <input
           type="range"
           value={fontSize}
           onChange={(e) => setFontSize(Number(e.target.value))}
         />
       );
     }
     ```

     Both components use `useLocalStorage`, but each has **its own independent state** that persists to localStorage.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

289.  ### What is the useDebugValue hook?

     The `useDebugValue` hook is used to **display a label** for custom hooks in **React DevTools**. It helps developers debug custom hooks by showing meaningful information.

     #### Syntax
     ```js
     useDebugValue(value);
     useDebugValue(value, formatFn); // With optional formatter
     ```

     #### Example: Custom Hook with Debug Value
     ```jsx
     import { useState, useEffect, useDebugValue } from 'react';

     function useOnlineStatus() {
       const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);

       useEffect(() => {
         const handleOnline = () => setIsOnline(true);
         const handleOffline = () => setIsOnline(false);

         window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
         window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);

         return () => {
           window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
           window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
         };
       }, []);

       // Shows "OnlineStatus: Online" or "OnlineStatus: Offline" in DevTools
       useDebugValue(isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline');

       return isOnline;
     }
     ```

     #### With Formatting Function (for expensive computations)
     ```jsx
     function useUser(userId) {
       const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

       // The format function only runs when DevTools is open
       useDebugValue(user, (user) => user ? `User: ${user.name}` : 'Loading...');

       return user;
     }
     ```

     **Note:** Only use `useDebugValue` in custom hooks that are part of shared libraries. It's not necessary for every custom hook in application code.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

290.  ### How do you handle cleanup in useEffect?

     The cleanup function in `useEffect` is used to **clean up side effects** before the component unmounts or before the effect runs again. This prevents memory leaks, stale data, and unexpected behavior.

     #### Syntax
     ```js
     useEffect(() => {
       // Setup code

       return () => {
         // Cleanup code
       };
     }, [dependencies]);
     ```

     #### Common Cleanup Scenarios

     **1. Event Listeners**
     ```jsx
     useEffect(() => {
       const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
       window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);

       return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
     }, []);
     ```

     **2. Timers and Intervals**
     ```jsx
     useEffect(() => {
       const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
         setCount(c => c + 1);
       }, 1000);

       return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
     }, []);
     ```

     **3. Subscriptions**
     ```jsx
     useEffect(() => {
       const subscription = dataSource.subscribe(handleChange);

       return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
     }, [dataSource]);
     ```

     **4. Abort Fetch Requests**
     ```jsx
     useEffect(() => {
       const controller = new AbortController();

       fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal })
         .then(response => response.json())
         .then(data => setData(data))
         .catch(err => {
           if (err.name !== 'AbortError') {
             setError(err);
           }
         });

       return () => controller.abort();
     }, [url]);
     ```

     **When Cleanup Runs:**
     - Before the component unmounts
     - Before re-running the effect when dependencies change

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

291.  ### What are the differences between useEffect and useEvent (experimental)?

     `useEvent` is an **experimental hook** (not yet stable in React) designed to solve the problem of creating **stable event handlers** that always access the latest props and state without causing re-renders or needing to be in dependency arrays.

     #### The Problem useEvent Solves
     ```jsx
     // Problem: onTick changes on every render, causing interval to reset
     function Timer({ onTick }) {
       useEffect(() => {
         const id = setInterval(() => {
           onTick(); // Uses stale closure if onTick is not in deps
         }, 1000);
         return () => clearInterval(id);
       }, [onTick]); // Adding onTick causes interval to reset frequently
     }
     ```

     #### Solution with useEvent (Experimental)
     ```jsx
     import { useEvent } from 'react'; // Experimental

     function Timer({ onTick }) {
       const stableOnTick = useEvent(onTick);

       useEffect(() => {
         const id = setInterval(() => {
           stableOnTick(); // Always calls latest onTick
         }, 1000);
         return () => clearInterval(id);
       }, []); // No dependency needed!
     }
     ```

     #### Key Differences

     | Feature | useEffect | useEvent (experimental) |
     |---------|-----------|------------------------|
     | Purpose | Run side effects | Create stable callbacks |
     | Runs | After render | During render (creates function) |
     | Returns | Cleanup function | Stable event handler |
     | Closure | Captures values at render time | Always accesses latest values |
     | Dependencies | Must list all used values | Not needed in other hooks' deps |

     **Note:** Until `useEvent` is stable, you can use `useCallback` with `useRef` as a workaround for stable callbacks.

292.  ### What are the best practices for using React Hooks?

     Following best practices ensures your hooks are predictable, maintainable, and bug-free.

     #### 1. **Follow the Rules of Hooks**
     - Only call hooks at the top level (not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions)
     - Only call hooks from React functions (components or custom hooks)

     #### 2. **Use the ESLint Plugin**
     ```bash
     npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev
     ```
     ```json
     {
       "plugins": ["react-hooks"],
       "rules": {
         "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error",
         "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn"
       }
     }
     ```

     #### 3. **Keep Hooks Focused and Simple**
     ```jsx
     // ❌ Bad: One hook doing too much
     function useEverything() {
       const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
       const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);
       const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');
       // ... lots of unrelated logic
     }

     // ✅ Good: Separate concerns
     function useUser() { /* user logic */ }
     function usePosts() { /* posts logic */ }
     function useTheme() { /* theme logic */ }
     ```

     #### 4. **Use Descriptive Names for Custom Hooks**
     ```jsx
     // ❌ Bad
     function useData() { }

     // ✅ Good
     function useUserAuthentication() { }
     function useFetchProducts() { }
     function useFormValidation() { }
     ```

     #### 5. **Properly Manage Dependencies**
     ```jsx
     // ❌ Bad: Missing dependency
     useEffect(() => {
       fetchUser(userId);
     }, []); // userId is missing

     // ✅ Good: All dependencies listed
     useEffect(() => {
       fetchUser(userId);
     }, [userId]);
     ```

     #### 6. **Avoid Inline Object/Function Dependencies**
     ```jsx
     // ❌ Bad: New object on every render
     useEffect(() => {
       doSomething(options);
     }, [{ page: 1, limit: 10 }]); // Always different reference

     // ✅ Good: Memoize or extract
     const options = useMemo(() => ({ page: 1, limit: 10 }), []);
     useEffect(() => {
       doSomething(options);
     }, [options]);
     ```

## Disclaimer

The questions provided in this repository are the summary of frequently asked questions across numerous companies. We cannot guarantee that these questions will actually be asked during your interview process, nor should you focus on memorizing all of them. The primary purpose is for you to get a sense of what some companies might ask — do not get discouraged if you don't know the answer to all of them ⁠— that is ok!

Good luck with your interview 😊

   ```javascript
   //Wrong
   this.state.message = "Hello world";
   ```

   Instead use `setState()` method. It schedules an update to a component's state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.

   ```javascript
   //Correct
   this.setState({ message: "Hello World" });
   ```

   **Note:** You can directly assign to the state object either in _constructor_ or using latest javascript's class field declaration syntax.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

293.  ### What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of `setState()`?

    The callback function provided as the second argument to `setState` is executed after the state has been updated and the component has re-rendered. Because `setState()` is asynchronous, you cannot reliably perform actions that require the updated state immediately after calling `setState`. The callback ensures your code runs only after the update and re-render are complete.

    #### Example

    ```jsx
    this.setState({ name: "Sudheer" }, () => {
      console.log("The name has been updated and the component has re-rendered.");
    });
    ```

    #### When to use the callback?

    Use the `setState` callback when you need to perform an action immediately after the DOM has been updated in response to a state change. i.e, The callback is a reliable way to perform actions after a state update and re-render, especially when the timing is critical due to the asynchronous nature of state updates in React. For example, if you need to interact with the updated DOM, trigger analytics, or perform further computations that depend on the new state or rendered output.

    #### Note

    - In modern React (with function components), you can achieve similar effects using the `useEffect` hook to respond to state changes.
    - In class components, you can also use lifecycle methods like `componentDidUpdate` for broader post-update logic.
    - The `setState` callback is still useful for one-off actions that directly follow a specific state change.

294.  ### How to bind methods or event handlers in JSX callbacks?

   There are 3 possible ways to achieve this in class components:

   1. **Binding in Constructor:** In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. The same rule applies for React event handlers defined as class methods. Normally we bind them in constructor.

      ```javascript
      class User extends Component {
        constructor(props) {
          super(props);
          this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
        }
        handleClick() {
          console.log("SingOut triggered");
        }
        render() {
          return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>SingOut</button>;
        }
      }
      ```

   2. **Public class fields syntax:** If you don't like to use bind approach then _public class fields syntax_ can be used to correctly bind callbacks. The Create React App enables this syntax by default.

      ```jsx harmony
      handleClick = () => {
        console.log("SingOut triggered", this);
      };
      ```

      ```jsx harmony
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>SingOut</button>
      ```

   3. **Arrow functions in callbacks:** It is possible to use _arrow functions_ directly in the callbacks.

      ```jsx harmony
      handleClick() {
          console.log('SingOut triggered');
      }
      render() {
          return <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>SignOut</button>;
      }
      ```

   **Note:** If the callback is passed as prop to child components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. In those cases, it is preferred to go with `.bind()` or _public class fields syntax_ approach considering performance.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

295.  ### How to pass a parameter to an event handler or callback?

   You can use an _arrow function_ to wrap around an _event handler_ and pass parameters:

   ```jsx harmony
   <button onClick={() => this.handleClick(id)} />
   ```

   This is an equivalent to calling `.bind`:

   ```jsx harmony
   <button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this, id)} />
   ```

   Apart from these two approaches, you can also pass arguments to a function which is defined as arrow function

   ```jsx harmony
   <button onClick={this.handleClick(id)} />;
   handleClick = (id) => () => {
     console.log("Hello, your ticket number is", id);
   };
   ```

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

296.  ### What is the use of refs?

   The _ref_ is used to return a reference to the element. They _should be avoided_ in most cases, however, they can be useful when you need a direct access to the DOM element or an instance of a component.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

297.  ### How to create refs?

   There are two approaches

   1. This is a recently added approach. _Refs_ are created using `React.createRef()` method and attached to React elements via the `ref` attribute. In order to use _refs_ throughout the component, just assign the _ref_ to the instance property within constructor.

      ```jsx harmony
      class MyComponent extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
          super(props);
          this.myRef = React.createRef();
        }
        render() {
          return <div ref={this.myRef} />;
        }
      }
      ```

   2. You can also use ref callbacks approach regardless of React version. For example, the search bar component's input element is accessed as follows,
      ```jsx harmony
      class SearchBar extends Component {
        constructor(props) {
          super(props);
          this.txtSearch = null;
          this.state = { term: "" };
          this.setInputSearchRef = (e) => {
            this.txtSearch = e;
          };
        }
        onInputChange(event) {
          this.setState({ term: this.txtSearch.value });
        }
        render() {
          return (
            <input
              value={this.state.term}
              onChange={this.onInputChange.bind(this)}
              ref={this.setInputSearchRef}
            />
          );
        }
      }
      ```

   You can also use _refs_ in function components using **closures**.
   **Note**: You can also use inline ref callbacks even though it is not a recommended approach.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

298.  ### What are forward refs?

   _Ref forwarding_ is a feature that lets some components take a _ref_ they receive, and pass it further down to a child.

   ```jsx harmony
   const ButtonElement = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (
     <button ref={ref} className="CustomButton">
       {props.children}
     </button>
   ));

   // Create ref to the DOM button:
   const ref = React.createRef();
   <ButtonElement ref={ref}>{"Forward Ref"}</ButtonElement>;
   ```

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

299.  ### Which is preferred option with in callback refs and findDOMNode()?

   It is preferred to use _callback refs_ over `findDOMNode()` API. Because `findDOMNode()` prevents certain improvements in React in the future.

   The **legacy** approach of using `findDOMNode`:

   ```javascript
   class MyComponent extends Component {
     componentDidMount() {
       findDOMNode(this).scrollIntoView();
     }

     render() {
       return <div />;
     }
   }
   ```

   The recommended approach is:

   ```javascript
   class MyComponent extends Component {
     constructor(props) {
       super(props);
       this.node = createRef();
     }
     componentDidMount() {
       this.node.current.scrollIntoView();
     }

     render() {
       return <div ref={this.node} />;
     }
   }
   ```

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

300.  ### Why are String Refs legacy?

   If you worked with React before, you might be familiar with an older API where the `ref` attribute is a string, like `ref={'textInput'}`, and the DOM node is accessed as `this.refs.textInput`. We advise against it because _string refs have below issues_, and are considered legacy. String refs were **removed in React v16**.

   1. They _force React to keep track of currently executing component_. This is problematic because it makes react module stateful, and thus causes weird errors when react module is duplicated in the bundle.
   2. They are _not composable_ — if a library puts a ref on the passed child, the user can't put another ref on it. Callback refs are perfectly composable.
   3. They _don't work with static analysis_ like Flow. Flow can't guess the magic that framework does to make the string ref appear on `this.refs`, as well as its type (which could be different). Callback refs are friendlier to static analysis.
   4. It doesn't work as most people would expect with the "render callback" pattern (e.g. `<DataGrid renderRow={this.renderRow} />`)

      ```jsx harmony
      class MyComponent extends Component {
        renderRow = (index) => {
          // This won't work. Ref will get attached to DataTable rather than MyComponent:
          return <input ref={"input-" + index} />;

          // This would work though! Callback refs are awesome.
          return <input ref={(input) => (this["input-" + index] = input)} />;
        };

        render() {
          return (
            <DataTable data={this.props.data} renderRow={this.renderRow} />
          );
        }
      }
      ```

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

301.  ### What are the different phases of component lifecycle?

    The component lifecycle has three distinct lifecycle phases:

    1. **Mounting:** The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from `constructor()`, `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `render()`, and `componentDidMount()` lifecycle methods.

    2. **Updating:** In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from `setState()` or `forceUpdate()`. This phase covers `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `shouldComponentUpdate()`, `render()`, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` and `componentDidUpdate()` lifecycle methods.

    3. **Unmounting:** In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method.

    It's worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows

    4. **Render** The component will render without any side effects. This applies to Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render.

    5. **Pre-commit** Before the component actually applies the changes to the DOM, there is a moment that allows React to read from the DOM through the `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`.

    6. **Commit** React works with the DOM and executes the final lifecycles respectively `componentDidMount()` for mounting, `componentDidUpdate()` for updating, and `componentWillUnmount()` for unmounting.

    React 16.3+ Phases (or an [interactive version](http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/))

    Before React 16.3

    ![phases 16.2](images/phases.png)

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

302.  ### What are the lifecycle methods of React?

    Before React 16.3

    - **componentWillMount:** Executed before rendering and is used for App level configuration in your root component.
    - **componentDidMount:** Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.
    - **componentWillReceiveProps:** Executed when particular prop updates to trigger state transitions.
    - **shouldComponentUpdate:** Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default it returns `true`. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop.
    - **componentWillUpdate:** Executed before re-rendering the component when there are props & state changes confirmed by `shouldComponentUpdate()` which returns true.
    - **componentDidUpdate:** Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.
    - **componentWillUnmount:** It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.

    React 16.3+

    - **getDerivedStateFromProps:** Invoked right before calling `render()` and is invoked on _every_ render. This exists for rare use cases where you need a derived state. Worth reading [if you need derived state](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html).
    - **componentDidMount:** Executed after first rendering and where all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.
    - **shouldComponentUpdate:** Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default, it returns `true`. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after the state or props are updated, you can return a false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives a new prop.
    - **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate:** Executed right before rendered output is committed to the DOM. Any value returned by this will be passed into `componentDidUpdate()`. This is useful to capture information from the DOM i.e. scroll position.
    - **componentDidUpdate:** Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes. This will not fire if `shouldComponentUpdate()` returns `false`.
    - **componentWillUnmount** It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.

303.  ### How to create props proxy for HOC component?

    You can add/edit props passed to the component using _props proxy_ pattern like this:

    ```jsx harmony
    function HOC(WrappedComponent) {
      return class Test extends Component {
        render() {
          const newProps = {
            title: "New Header",
            footer: false,
            showFeatureX: false,
            showFeatureY: true,
          };

          return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} {...newProps} />;
        }
      };
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

304.  ### What is context?

    _Context_ provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

    For example, authenticated users, locale preferences, UI themes need to be accessed in the application by many components.

    ```javascript
    const { Provider, Consumer } = React.createContext(defaultValue);
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

305.  ### What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument?

    A child class constructor cannot make use of `this` reference until the `super()` method has been called. The same applies to ES6 sub-classes as well. The main reason for passing props parameter to `super()` call is to access `this.props` in your child constructors.

    **Passing props:**

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        console.log(this.props); // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
      }
    }
    ```

    **Not passing props:**

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super();

        console.log(this.props); // prints undefined

        // but props parameter is still available
        console.log(props); // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
      }

      render() {
        // no difference outside constructor
        console.log(this.props); // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
      }
    }
    ```

    The above code snippets reveals that `this.props` is different only within the constructor. It would be the same outside the constructor.

306.  ### How to set state with a dynamic key name?

    If you are using ES6 or the Babel transpiler to transform your JSX code then you can accomplish this with _computed property names_.

    ```javascript
    handleInputChange(event) {
      this.setState({ [event.target.id]: event.target.value })
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

307.  ### What would be the common mistake of function being called every time the component renders?

    You need to make sure that function is not being called while passing the function as a parameter.

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      // Wrong: handleClick is called instead of passed as a reference!
      return <button onClick={this.handleClick()}>{'Click Me'}</button>
    }
    ```

    Instead, pass the function itself without parenthesis:

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      // Correct: handleClick is passed as a reference!
      return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>{'Click Me'}</button>
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

308.  ### What are error boundaries in React v16?

    _Error boundaries_ are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

    A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines a new lifecycle method called `componentDidCatch(error, info)` or `static getDerivedStateFromError() `:

    ```jsx harmony
    class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { hasError: false };
      }

      componentDidCatch(error, info) {
        // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
        logErrorToMyService(error, info);
      }

      static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
        // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
        return { hasError: true };
      }

      render() {
        if (this.state.hasError) {
          // You can render any custom fallback UI
          return <h1>{"Something went wrong."}</h1>;
        }
        return this.props.children;
      }
    }
    ```

    After that use it as a regular component:

    ```jsx harmony
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <MyWidget />
    </ErrorBoundary>
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

309.  ### How are error boundaries handled in React v15?

    React v15 provided very basic support for _error boundaries_ using `unstable_handleError` method. It has been renamed to `componentDidCatch` in React v16.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

310.  ### What is the purpose of render method of `react-dom`?

    This method is used to render a React element into the DOM in the supplied container and return a reference to the component. If the React element was previously rendered into container, it will perform an update on it and only mutate the DOM as necessary to reflect the latest changes.

    ```
    ReactDOM.render(element, container, [callback])
    ```

    If the optional callback is provided, it will be executed after the component is rendered or updated.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

311.  ### What will happen if you use `setState()` in constructor?

    When you use `setState()`, then apart from assigning to the object state React also re-renders the component and all its children. You would get error like this: _Can only update a mounted or mounting component._ So we need to use `this.state` to initialize variables inside constructor.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

312.  ### Is it good to use `setState()` in `componentWillMount()` method?

    Yes, it is safe to use `setState()` inside `componentWillMount()` method. But at the same it is recommended to avoid async initialization in `componentWillMount()` lifecycle method. `componentWillMount()` is invoked immediately before mounting occurs. It is called before `render()`, therefore setting state in this method will not trigger a re-render. Avoid introducing any side-effects or subscriptions in this method. We need to make sure async calls for component initialization happened in `componentDidMount()` instead of `componentWillMount()`.

    ```jsx harmony
    componentDidMount() {
      axios.get(`api/todos`)
        .then((result) => {
          this.setState({
            messages: [...result.data]
          })
        })
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

313.  ### What will happen if you use props in initial state?

    If the props on the component are changed without the component being refreshed, the new prop value will never be displayed because the constructor function will never update the current state of the component. The initialization of state from props only runs when the component is first created.

    The below component won't display the updated input value:

    ```jsx harmony
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
          records: [],
          inputValue: this.props.inputValue,
        };
      }

      render() {
        return <div>{this.state.inputValue}</div>;
      }
    }
    ```

    Using props inside render method will update the value:

    ```jsx harmony
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
          record: [],
        };
      }

      render() {
        return <div>{this.props.inputValue}</div>;
      }
    }
    ```

314.  ### How you use decorators in React?

    You can _decorate_ your _class_ components, which is the same as passing the component into a function. **Decorators** are flexible and readable way of modifying component functionality.

    ```jsx harmony
    @setTitle("Profile")
    class Profile extends React.Component {
      //....
    }

    /*
      title is a string that will be set as a document title
      WrappedComponent is what our decorator will receive when
      put directly above a component class as seen in the example above
    */
    const setTitle = (title) => (WrappedComponent) => {
      return class extends React.Component {
        componentDidMount() {
          document.title = title;
        }

        render() {
          return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
        }
      };
    };
    ```

    **Note:** Decorators are a feature that didn't make it into ES7, but are currently a _stage 2 proposal_.

315.  ### What is CRA and its benefits?

    The `create-react-app` CLI tool allows you to quickly create & run React applications with no configuration step.

    Let's create Todo App using _CRA_:

    ```console
    # Installation
    $ npm install -g create-react-app

    # Create new project
    $ create-react-app todo-app
    $ cd todo-app

    # Build, test and run
    $ npm run build
    $ npm run test
    $ npm start
    ```

    It includes everything we need to build a React app:

    1. React, JSX, ES6, and Flow syntax support.
    2. Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
    3. Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need -webkit- or other prefixes.
    4. A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
    5. A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
    6. A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.

316.  ### What is the lifecycle methods order in mounting?

    The lifecycle methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.

    1. `constructor()`
    2. `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`
    3. `render()`
    4. `componentDidMount()`

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

317.  ### What are the lifecycle methods going to be deprecated in React v16?

    The following lifecycle methods going to be unsafe coding practices and will be more problematic with async rendering.

    1. `componentWillMount()`
    2. `componentWillReceiveProps()`
    3. `componentWillUpdate()`

    Starting with React v16.3 these methods are aliased with `UNSAFE_` prefix, and the unprefixed version will be removed in React v17.

318.  ### What is the purpose of `getDerivedStateFromProps()` lifecycle method?

    The new static `getDerivedStateFromProps()` lifecycle method is invoked after a component is instantiated as well as before it is re-rendered. It can return an object to update state, or `null` to indicate that the new props do not require any state updates.

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```

    This lifecycle method along with `componentDidUpdate()` covers all the use cases of `componentWillReceiveProps()`.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

319.  ### What is the purpose of `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` lifecycle method?

    The new `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` lifecycle method is called right before DOM updates. The return value from this method will be passed as the third parameter to `componentDidUpdate()`.

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```

    This lifecycle method along with `componentDidUpdate()` covers all the use cases of `componentWillUpdate()`.

320.  ### What is the recommended way for naming components?

    It is recommended to name the component by reference instead of using `displayName`.

    Using `displayName` for naming component:

    ```javascript
    export default React.createClass({
      displayName: "TodoApp",
      // ...
    });
    ```

    The **recommended** approach:

    ```javascript
    export default class TodoApp extends React.Component {
      // ...
    }
    ```

    also

    ```javascript
    const TodoApp = () => {
      //...
    };
    export default TodoApp;
    ```

321.  ### What is the recommended ordering of methods in component class?

    _Recommended_ ordering of methods from _mounting_ to _render stage_:

    1. `static` methods
    2. `constructor()`
    3. `getChildContext()`
    4. `componentWillMount()`
    5. `componentDidMount()`
    6. `componentWillReceiveProps()`
    7. `shouldComponentUpdate()`
    8. `componentWillUpdate()`
    9. `componentDidUpdate()`
    10. `componentWillUnmount()`
    11. click handlers or event handlers like `onClickSubmit()` or `onChangeDescription()`
    12. getter methods for render like `getSelectReason()` or `getFooterContent()`
    13. optional render methods like `renderNavigation()` or `renderProfilePicture()`
    14. `render()`

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

322.  ### Why we need to pass a function to setState()?

    The reason behind for this is that `setState()` is an asynchronous operation. React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change immediately after `setState()` is called. That means you should not rely on the current state when calling `setState()` since you can't be sure what that state will be. The solution is to pass a function to `setState()`, with the previous state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of `setState()`.

    Let's say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.

    ```javascript
    // assuming this.state.count === 0
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    // this.state.count === 1, not 3
    ```

    If we pass a function to `setState()`, the count gets incremented correctly.

    ```javascript
    this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
      count: prevState.count + props.increment,
    }));
    // this.state.count === 3 as expected
    ```

    **(OR)**

    ### Why function is preferred over object for `setState()`?

    React may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update for performance. Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.

    This counter example will fail to update as expected:

    ```javascript
    // Wrong
    this.setState({
      counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
    });
    ```

    The preferred approach is to call `setState()` with function rather than object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument.

    ```javascript
    // Correct
    this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
      counter: prevState.counter + props.increment,
    }));
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

323.  ### Why is `isMounted()` an anti-pattern and what is the proper solution?

    The primary use case for `isMounted()` is to avoid calling `setState()` after a component has been unmounted, because it will emit a warning.

    ```javascript
    if (this.isMounted()) {
      this.setState({...})
    }
    ```

    Checking `isMounted()` before calling `setState()` does eliminate the warning, but it also defeats the purpose of the warning. Using `isMounted()` is a code smell because the only reason you would check is because you think you might be holding a reference after the component has unmounted.

    An optimal solution would be to find places where `setState()` might be called after a component has unmounted, and fix them. Such situations most commonly occur due to callbacks, when a component is waiting for some data and gets unmounted before the data arrives. Ideally, any callbacks should be canceled in `componentWillUnmount()`, prior to unmounting.

324.  ### What is the difference between constructor and getInitialState?

    You should initialize state in the constructor when using ES6 classes, and `getInitialState()` method when using `React.createClass()`.

    **Using ES6 classes:**

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
          /* initial state */
        };
      }
    }
    ```

    **Using `React.createClass()`:**

    ```javascript
    const MyComponent = React.createClass({
      getInitialState() {
        return {
          /* initial state */
        };
      },
    });
    ```

    **Note:** `React.createClass()` is deprecated and removed in React v16. Use plain JavaScript classes instead.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

325.  ### Can you force a component to re-render without calling setState?

    By default, when your component's state or props change, your component will re-render. If your `render()` method depends on some other data, you can tell React that the component needs re-rendering by calling `forceUpdate()`.

    ```javascript
    component.forceUpdate(callback);
    ```

    It is recommended to avoid all uses of `forceUpdate()` and only read from `this.props` and `this.state` in `render()`.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

326.  ### What is the difference between `super()` and `super(props)` in React using ES6 classes?

    When you want to access `this.props` in `constructor()` then you should pass props to `super()` method.

    **Using `super(props)`:**

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        console.log(this.props); // { name: 'John', ... }
      }
    }
    ```

    **Using `super()`:**

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super();
        console.log(this.props); // undefined
      }
    }
    ```

    Outside `constructor()` both will display same value for `this.props`.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

327.  ### What is the difference between `setState()` and `replaceState()` methods?

    When you use `setState()` the current and previous states are merged. `replaceState()` throws out the current state, and replaces it with only what you provide. Usually `setState()` is used unless you really need to remove all previous keys for some reason. You can also set state to `false`/`null` in `setState()` instead of using `replaceState()`.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

328.  ### How to listen to state changes?

    The `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method will be called when state changes. You can compare provided state and props values with current state and props to determine if something meaningful changed.

    ```
    componentDidUpdate(object prevProps, object prevState)
    ```

    **Note:** The previous releases of ReactJS also uses `componentWillUpdate(object nextProps, object nextState)` for state changes. It has been deprecated in latest releases.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

329.  ### What is the recommended approach of removing an array element in React state?

    The better approach is to use `Array.prototype.filter()` method.

    For example, let's create a `removeItem()` method for updating the state.

    ```javascript
    removeItem(index) {
      this.setState({
        data: this.state.data.filter((item, i) => i !== index)
      })
    }
    ```

330.  ### Is it possible to use React without rendering HTML?

    It is possible. Below are the possible options:

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return false
    }
    ```

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return true
    }
    ```

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return null
    }
    ```

    React version >=16.0.0:

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return []
    }
    ```

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return ""
    }
    ```

    React version >=16.2.0:

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>
    }
    ```

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return <></>
    }
    ```

    React version >=18.0.0:

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return undefined
    }
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

331.  ### What are the possible ways of updating objects in state?

    1.  **Calling `setState()` with an object to merge with state:**

        - Using `Object.assign()` to create a copy of the object:

          ```javascript
          const user = Object.assign({}, this.state.user, { age: 42 });
          this.setState({ user });
          ```

        - Using _spread operator_:

          ```javascript
          const user = { ...this.state.user, age: 42 };
          this.setState({ user });
          ```

    2.  **Calling `setState()` with a function:**

        ```javascript
        this.setState((prevState) => ({
          user: {
            ...prevState.user,
            age: 42,
          },
        }));
        ```

332.  ### What are the approaches to include polyfills in your `create-react-app`?

    There are approaches to include polyfills in create-react-app,

    1.  **Manual import from `core-js`:**

        Create a file called (something like) `polyfills.js` and import it into root `index.js` file. Run `npm install core-js` or `yarn add core-js` and import your specific required features.

        ```javascript
        import "core-js/fn/array/find";
        import "core-js/fn/array/includes";
        import "core-js/fn/number/is-nan";
        ```

    2.  **Using Polyfill service:**

        Use the polyfill.io CDN to retrieve custom, browser-specific polyfills by adding this line to `index.html`:

        ```html
        <script src="https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js?features=default,Array.prototype.includes"></script>
        ```

        In the above script we had to explicitly request the `Array.prototype.includes` feature as it is not included in the default feature set.

333.  ### How to use https instead of http in create-react-app?

    You just need to use `HTTPS=true` configuration. You can edit your `package.json` scripts section:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "start": "set HTTPS=true && react-scripts start"
    }
    ```

    or just run `set HTTPS=true && npm start`

408.  ### How to avoid using relative path imports in create-react-app?

    Create a file called `.env` in the project root and write the import path:

    ```
    NODE_PATH=src/app
    ```

    After that restart the development server. Now you should be able to import anything inside `src/app` without relative paths.

409.  ### How to update a component every second?

    You need to use `setInterval()` to trigger the change, but you also need to clear the timer when the component unmounts to prevent errors and memory leaks.

    ```javascript
    componentDidMount() {
      this.interval = setInterval(() => this.setState({ time: Date.now() }), 1000)
    }

    componentWillUnmount() {
      clearInterval(this.interval)
    }
    ```

410.  ### Why is a component constructor called only once?

    React's _reconciliation_ algorithm assumes that without any information to the contrary, if a custom component appears in the same place on subsequent renders, it's the same component as before, so reuses the previous instance rather than creating a new one.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

411.  ### How to define constants in React?

    You can use ES7 `static` field to define constant.

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      static DEFAULT_PAGINATION = 10;
    }
    ```

412.  ### How to programmatically trigger click event in React?

    You could use the ref prop to acquire a reference to the underlying `HTMLInputElement` object through a callback, store the reference as a class property, then use that reference to later trigger a click from your event handlers using the `HTMLElement.click` method.

    This can be done in two steps:

    1.  Create ref in render method:

        ```jsx harmony
        <input ref={(input) => (this.inputElement = input)} />
        ```

    2.  Apply click event in your event handler:

        ```javascript
        this.inputElement.click();
        ```

413.  ### How to make AJAX call and in which component lifecycle methods should I make an AJAX call?

    You can use AJAX libraries such as Axios, jQuery AJAX, and the browser built-in `fetch`. You should fetch data in the `componentDidMount()` lifecycle method. This is so you can use `setState()` to update your component when the data is retrieved.

    For example, the employees list fetched from API and set local state:

    ```jsx harmony
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
          employees: [],
          error: null,
        };
      }

      componentDidMount() {
        fetch("https://api.example.com/items")
          .then((res) => res.json())
          .then(
            (result) => {
              this.setState({
                employees: result.employees,
              });
            },
            (error) => {
              this.setState({ error });
            }
          );
      }

      render() {
        const { error, employees } = this.state;
        if (error) {
          return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
        } else {
          return (
            <ul>
              {employees.map((employee) => (
                <li key={employee.name}>
                  {employee.name}-{employee.experience}
                </li>
              ))}
            </ul>
          );
        }
      }
    }
    ```

414.  ### What are render props?

    **Render Props** is a simple technique for sharing code between components using a prop whose value is a function. The below component uses render prop which returns a React element.

    ```jsx harmony
    <DataProvider render={(data) => <h1>{`Hello ${data.target}`}</h1>} />
    ```

    Libraries such as React Router and DownShift are using this pattern.

415.  ### How to dispatch an action on load?

    You can dispatch an action in `componentDidMount()` method and in `render()` method you can verify the data.

    ```javascript
    class App extends Component {
      componentDidMount() {
        this.props.fetchData();
      }

      render() {
        return this.props.isLoaded ? (
          <div>{"Loaded"}</div>
        ) : (
          <div>{"Not Loaded"}</div>
        );
      }
    }

    const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
      isLoaded: state.isLoaded,
    });

    const mapDispatchToProps = { fetchData };

    export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(App);
    ```

416.  ### How to use `connect()` from React Redux?

    You need to follow two steps to use your store in your container:

    1.  **Use `mapStateToProps()`:** It maps the state variables from your store to the props that you specify.
    2.  **Connect the above props to your container:** The object returned by the `mapStateToProps` function is connected to the container. You can import `connect()` from `react-redux`.

        ```jsx harmony
        import React from "react";
        import { connect } from "react-redux";

        class App extends React.Component {
          render() {
            return <div>{this.props.containerData}</div>;
          }
        }

        function mapStateToProps(state) {
          return { containerData: state.data };
        }

        export default connect(mapStateToProps)(App);
        ```

417.  ### Whats the purpose of `at` symbol in the Redux connect decorator?

    The **@** symbol is in fact a JavaScript expression used to signify decorators. _Decorators_ make it possible to annotate and modify classes and properties at design time.

    Let's take an example setting up Redux without and with a decorator.

    - **Without decorator:**

      ```javascript
      import React from "react";
      import * as actionCreators from "./actionCreators";
      import { bindActionCreators } from "redux";
      import { connect } from "react-redux";

      function mapStateToProps(state) {
        return { todos: state.todos };
      }

      function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
        return { actions: bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch) };
      }

      class MyApp extends React.Component {
        // ...define your main app here
      }

      export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyApp);
      ```

    - **With decorator:**

      ```javascript
      import React from "react";
      import * as actionCreators from "./actionCreators";
      import { bindActionCreators } from "redux";
      import { connect } from "react-redux";

      function mapStateToProps(state) {
        return { todos: state.todos };
      }

      function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
        return { actions: bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch) };
      }

      @connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)
      export default class MyApp extends React.Component {
        // ...define your main app here
      }
      ```

    The above examples are almost similar except the usage of decorator. The decorator syntax isn't built into any JavaScript runtimes yet, and is still experimental and subject to change. You can use babel for the decorators support.

418.  ### How to use TypeScript in `create-react-app` application?

        Starting from react-scripts@3.3.0+ releases onwards, you can now optionally start a new app from a template by appending `--template [template-name]` to the creation command. If you don't select a template, it will create your project with base template. Remember that templates are always named in the format `cra-template-[template-name]`, here you only need to fill the `[template-name]` section.

        The typeScript can be used in your project by appending `--template typescript` to the creation command.

         ```bash
         npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
         ```

        But if you are using React Scripting between react-scripts@2.1.0 and react-scripts@3.2.x , there is a built-in support for TypeScript. i.e, `create-react-app` now supports TypeScript natively. You can just pass `--typescript` option as below

         ```bash
         npx create-react-app my-app --typescript

         # or

         yarn create react-app my-app --typescript
         ```

         Whereas for lower versions of react scripts, just supply `--scripts-version` option as `react-scripts-ts` while you create a new project. `react-scripts-ts` is a set of adjustments to take the standard `create-react-app` project pipeline and bring TypeScript into the mix.

         Now the project layout should look like the following:

         ```
         my-app/
         ├─ .gitignore
         ├─ images.d.ts
         ├─ node_modules/
         ├─ public/
         ├─ src/
         │  └─ ...
         ├─ package.json
         ├─ tsconfig.json
         ├─ tsconfig.prod.json
         ├─ tsconfig.test.json
         └─ tslint.json
         ```

419.  ### Does the statics object work with ES6 classes in React?

    No, `statics` only works with `React.createClass()`:

    ```javascript
    someComponent = React.createClass({
      statics: {
        someMethod: function () {
          // ..
        },
      },
    });
    ```

    But you can write statics inside ES6+ classes as below,

    ```javascript
    class Component extends React.Component {
      static propTypes = {
        // ...
      };

      static someMethod() {
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```

    or writing them outside class as below,

    ```javascript
    class Component extends React.Component {
       ....
    }

    Component.propTypes = {...}
    Component.someMethod = function(){....}
    ```

420.  ### Why are inline ref callbacks or functions not recommended?

    If the ref callback is defined as an inline function, it will get called twice during updates, first with null and then again with the DOM element. This is because a new instance of the function is created with each render, so React needs to clear the old ref and set up the new one.

    ```jsx
    class UserForm extends Component {
      handleSubmit = () => {
        console.log("Input Value is: ", this.input.value);
      };

      render() {
        return (
          <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
            <input type="text" ref={(input) => (this.input = input)} /> //
            Access DOM input in handle submit
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
          </form>
        );
      }
    }
    ```

    But our expectation is for the ref callback to get called once, when the component mounts. One quick fix is to use the ES7 class property syntax to define the function

    ```jsx
    class UserForm extends Component {
      handleSubmit = () => {
        console.log("Input Value is: ", this.input.value);
      };

      setSearchInput = (input) => {
        this.input = input;
      };

      render() {
        return (
          <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
            <input type="text" ref={this.setSearchInput} /> // Access DOM input
            in handle submit
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
          </form>
        );
      }
    }
    ```

421.  ### What are HOC factory implementations?

    There are two main ways of implementing HOCs in React.

    1.  Props Proxy (PP) and
    2.  Inheritance Inversion (II).

    But they follow different approaches for manipulating the _WrappedComponent_.

    **Props Proxy**

    In this approach, the render method of the HOC returns a React Element of the type of the WrappedComponent. We also pass through the props that the HOC receives, hence the name **Props Proxy**.

    ```jsx
    function ppHOC(WrappedComponent) {
      return class PP extends React.Component {
        render() {
          return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
        }
      };
    }
    ```

    **Inheritance Inversion**

    In this approach, the returned HOC class (Enhancer) extends the WrappedComponent. It is called Inheritance Inversion because instead of the WrappedComponent extending some Enhancer class, it is passively extended by the Enhancer. In this way the relationship between them seems **inverse**.

    ```jsx
    function iiHOC(WrappedComponent) {
      return class Enhancer extends WrappedComponent {
        render() {
          return super.render();
        }
      };
    }
    ```

422.  ### How to use class field declarations syntax in React classes?

    React Class Components can be made much more concise using the class field declarations. You can initialize the local state without using the constructor and declare class methods by using arrow functions without the extra need to bind them.

    Let's take a counter example to demonstrate class field declarations for state without using constructor and methods without binding,

    ```jsx
    class Counter extends Component {
      state = { value: 0 };

      handleIncrement = () => {
        this.setState((prevState) => ({
          value: prevState.value + 1,
        }));
      };

      handleDecrement = () => {
        this.setState((prevState) => ({
          value: prevState.value - 1,
        }));
      };

      render() {
        return (
          <div>
            {this.state.value}

            <button onClick={this.handleIncrement}>+</button>
            <button onClick={this.handleDecrement}>-</button>
          </div>
        );
      }
    }
    ```

423.  ### Why do you not need error boundaries for event handlers?

    Error boundaries do not catch errors inside event handlers.

    React doesn’t need error boundaries to recover from errors in event handlers. Unlike the render method and lifecycle methods, the event handlers don’t happen during rendering. So if they throw, React still knows what to display on the screen.

    If you need to catch an error inside an event handler, use the regular JavaScript try / catch statement:

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { error: null };
        this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
      }

      handleClick() {
        try {
          // Do something that could throw
        } catch (error) {
          this.setState({ error });
        }
      }

      render() {
        if (this.state.error) {
          return <h1>Caught an error.</h1>;
        }
        return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
      }
    }
    ```

    Note that the above example is demonstrating regular JavaScript behavior and doesn’t use error boundaries.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

424.  ### What is the difference between try catch block and error boundaries?

    Try catch block works with imperative code whereas error boundaries are meant for declarative code to render on the screen.

    For example, the try catch block used for below imperative code

    ```javascript
    try {
      showButton();
    } catch (error) {
      // ...
    }
    ```

    Whereas error boundaries wrap declarative code as below,

    ```javascript
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <MyComponent />
    </ErrorBoundary>
    ```

    So if an error occurs in a **componentDidUpdate** method caused by a **setState** somewhere deep in the tree, it will still correctly propagate to the closest error boundary.

425.  ### What is the required method to be defined for a class component?
    The `render()` method is the only required method in a class component. i.e, All methods other than render method are optional for a class component.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

426.  ### What are the possible return types of render method?

    Below are the list of following types used and return from render method,

    1.  **React elements:** Elements that instruct React to render a DOM node. It includes html elements such as `<div/>` and user defined elements.
    2.  **Arrays and fragments:** Return multiple elements to render as Arrays and Fragments to wrap multiple elements
    3.  **Portals:** Render children into a different DOM subtree.
    4.  **String and numbers:** Render both Strings and Numbers as text nodes in the DOM
    5.  **Booleans or null:** Doesn't render anything but these types are used to conditionally render content.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

427.  ### What is the main purpose of constructor?

    The constructor is mainly used for two purposes,

    1.  To initialize local state by assigning object to this.state
    2.  For binding event handler methods to the instance
        For example, the below code covers both the above cases,

    ```javascript
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      // Don't call this.setState() here!
      this.state = { counter: 0 };
      this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
    }
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

428.  ### Is it mandatory to define constructor for React component?
    No, it is not mandatory. i.e, If you don’t initialize state and you don’t bind methods, you don’t need to implement a constructor for your React component.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

429.  ### Why should not call setState in componentWillUnmount?
    You should not call `setState()` in `componentWillUnmount()` because once a component instance is unmounted, it will never be mounted again.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

430.  ### What is the purpose of getDerivedStateFromError?

    This lifecycle method is invoked after an error has been thrown by a descendant component. It receives the error that was thrown as a parameter and should return a value to update state.

    The signature of the lifecycle method is as follows,

    ```javascript
    static getDerivedStateFromError(error)
    ```

    Let us take error boundary use case with the above lifecycle method for demonstration purpose,

    ```javascript
    class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { hasError: false };
      }

      static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
        // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
        return { hasError: true };
      }

      render() {
        if (this.state.hasError) {
          // You can render any custom fallback UI
          return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
        }

        return this.props.children;
      }
    }
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

431.  ### What is the methods order when component re-rendered?

    An update can be caused by changes to props or state. The below methods are called in the following order when a component is being re-rendered.

    1.  static getDerivedStateFromProps()
    2.  shouldComponentUpdate()
    3.  render()
    4.  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
    5.  componentDidUpdate()

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

432.  ### What are the methods invoked during error handling?

    Below methods are called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.

    1.  static getDerivedStateFromError()
    2.  componentDidCatch()

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

433.  ### What is the purpose of unmountComponentAtNode method?

    This method is available from react-dom package and it removes a mounted React component from the DOM and clean up its event handlers and state. If no component was mounted in the container, calling this function does nothing. Returns true if a component was unmounted and false if there was no component to unmount.

    The method signature would be as follows,

    ```javascript
    ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(container);
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

434.  ### What are the limitations with HOCs?

    Higher-order components come with a few caveats apart from its benefits. Below are the few listed in an order,

    1.  **Don’t use HOCs inside the render method:**
        It is not recommended to apply a HOC to a component within the render method of a component.

        ```javascript
        render() {
          // A new version of EnhancedComponent is created on every render
          // EnhancedComponent1 !== EnhancedComponent2
          const EnhancedComponent = enhance(MyComponent);
          // That causes the entire subtree to unmount/remount each time!
          return <EnhancedComponent />;
        }
        ```

        The above code impacts on performance by remounting a component that causes the state of that component and all of its children to be lost. Instead, apply HOCs outside the component definition so that the resulting component is created only once.

    2.  **Static methods must be copied over:**
        When you apply a HOC to a component the new component does not have any of the static methods of the original component

        ```javascript
        // Define a static method
        WrappedComponent.staticMethod = function () {
          /*...*/
        };
        // Now apply a HOC
        const EnhancedComponent = enhance(WrappedComponent);

        // The enhanced component has no static method
        typeof EnhancedComponent.staticMethod === "undefined"; // true
        ```

        You can overcome this by copying the methods onto the container before returning it,

        ```javascript
        function enhance(WrappedComponent) {
          class Enhance extends React.Component {
            /*...*/
          }
          // Must know exactly which method(s) to copy :(
          Enhance.staticMethod = WrappedComponent.staticMethod;
          return Enhance;
        }
        ```

    3.  **Refs aren’t passed through:**
        For HOCs you need to pass through all props to the wrapped component but this does not work for refs. This is because ref is not really a prop similar to key. In this case you need to use the React.forwardRef API

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

435.  ### How to debug forwardRefs in DevTools?

    **React.forwardRef** accepts a render function as parameter and DevTools uses this function to determine what to display for the ref forwarding component.

    For example, If you don't name the render function or not using displayName property then it will appear as ”ForwardRef” in the DevTools,

    ```javascript
    const WrappedComponent = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
      return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;
    });
    ```

    But If you name the render function then it will appear as **”ForwardRef(myFunction)”**

    ```javascript
    const WrappedComponent = React.forwardRef(function myFunction(props, ref) {
      return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;
    });
    ```

    As an alternative, You can also set displayName property for forwardRef function,

    ```javascript
    function logProps(Component) {
      class LogProps extends React.Component {
        // ...
      }

      function forwardRef(props, ref) {
        return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;
      }

      // Give this component a more helpful display name in DevTools.
      // e.g. "ForwardRef(logProps(MyComponent))"
      const name = Component.displayName || Component.name;
      forwardRef.displayName = `logProps(${name})`;

      return React.forwardRef(forwardRef);
    }
    ```

436.  ### Is it good to use arrow functions in render methods?

    Yes, You can use. It is often the easiest way to pass parameters to callback functions. But you need to optimize the performance while using it.

    ```javascript
    class Foo extends Component {
      handleClick() {
        console.log("Click happened");
      }
      render() {
        return <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>Click Me</button>;
      }
    }
    ```

    **Note:** Using an arrow function in render method creates a new function each time the component renders, which may have performance implications

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

437.  ### How do you say that state updates are merged?

    When you call setState() in the component, React merges the object you provide into the current state.

    For example, let us take a facebook user with posts and comments details as state variables,

    ```javascript
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
          posts: [],
          comments: []
        };
      }
    ```

    Now you can update them independently with separate `setState()` calls as below,

    ```javascript
     componentDidMount() {
        fetchPosts().then(response => {
          this.setState({
            posts: response.posts
          });
        });

        fetchComments().then(response => {
          this.setState({
            comments: response.comments
          });
        });
      }
    ```

    As mentioned in the above code snippets, `this.setState({comments})` updates only comments variable without modifying or replacing `posts` variable.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

438.  ### How do you pass arguments to an event handler?

    During iterations or loops, it is common to pass an extra parameter to an event handler. This can be achieved through arrow functions or bind method.

    Let us take an example of user details updated in a grid,

    ```javascript
    <button onClick={(e) => this.updateUser(userId, e)}>Update User details</button>
    <button onClick={this.updateUser.bind(this, userId)}>Update User details</button>
    ```

    In the both approaches, the synthetic argument `e` is passed as a second argument. You need to pass it explicitly for arrow functions and it will be passed automatically for `bind` method.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

439.  ### How to prevent component from rendering?

    You can prevent component from rendering by returning null based on specific condition. This way it can conditionally render component.

    ```javascript
    function Greeting(props) {
      if (!props.loggedIn) {
        return null;
      }

      return <div className="greeting">welcome, {props.name}</div>;
    }
    ```

    ```javascript
    class User extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {loggedIn: false, name: 'John'};
      }

      render() {
       return (
           <div>
             //Prevent component render if it is not loggedIn
             <Greeting loggedIn={this.state.loggedIn} />
             <UserDetails name={this.state.name}>
           </div>
       );
      }
    ```

    In the above example, the `greeting` component skips its rendering section by applying condition and returning null value.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

440.  ### Give an example on How to use context?

    **Context** is designed to share data that can be considered **global** for a tree of React components.

    For example, in the code below lets manually thread through a “theme” prop in order to style the Button component.

    ```javascript
    //Lets create a context with a default theme value "luna"
    const ThemeContext = React.createContext("luna");
    // Create App component where it uses provider to pass theme value in the tree
    class App extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return (
          <ThemeContext.Provider value="nova">
            <Toolbar />
          </ThemeContext.Provider>
        );
      }
    }
    // A middle component where you don't need to pass theme prop anymore
    function Toolbar(props) {
      return (
        <div>
          <ThemedButton />
        </div>
      );
    }
    // Lets read theme value in the button component to use
    class ThemedButton extends React.Component {
      static contextType = ThemeContext;
      render() {
        return <Button theme={this.context} />;
      }
    }
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

441.  ### How do you use contextType?

    ContextType is used to consume the context object. The contextType property can be used in two ways,

    1.  **contextType as property of class:**
        The contextType property on a class can be assigned a Context object created by React.createContext(). After that, you can consume the nearest current value of that Context type using this.context in any of the lifecycle methods and render function.

        Lets assign contextType property on MyClass as below,

        ```javascript
        class MyClass extends React.Component {
          componentDidMount() {
            let value = this.context;
            /* perform a side-effect at mount using the value of MyContext */
          }
          componentDidUpdate() {
            let value = this.context;
            /* ... */
          }
          componentWillUnmount() {
            let value = this.context;
            /* ... */
          }
          render() {
            let value = this.context;
            /* render something based on the value of MyContext */
          }
        }
        MyClass.contextType = MyContext;
        ```

    2.  **Static field**
        You can use a static class field to initialize your contextType using public class field syntax.

        ```javascript
        class MyClass extends React.Component {
          static contextType = MyContext;
          render() {
            let value = this.context;
            /* render something based on the value */
          }
        }
        ```

442.  ### What is a consumer?

    A Consumer is a React component that subscribes to context changes. It requires a function as a child which receives current context value as argument and returns a react node. The value argument passed to the function will be equal to the value prop of the closest Provider for this context above in the tree.

    Lets take a simple example,

    ```javascript
    <MyContext.Consumer>
      {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
    </MyContext.Consumer>
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

443.  ### How do you solve performance corner cases while using context?

    The context uses reference identity to determine when to re-render, there are some gotchas that could trigger unintentional renders in consumers when a provider’s parent re-renders.

    For example, the code below will re-render all consumers every time the Provider re-renders because a new object is always created for value.

    ```javascript
    class App extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return (
          <Provider value={{ something: "something" }}>
            <Toolbar />
          </Provider>
        );
      }
    }
    ```

    This can be solved by lifting up the value to parent state,

    ```javascript
    class App extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
          value: { something: "something" },
        };
      }

      render() {
        return (
          <Provider value={this.state.value}>
            <Toolbar />
          </Provider>
        );
      }
    }
    ```

444.  ### What is the purpose of forward ref in HOCs?

    Refs will not get passed through because ref is not a prop. It is handled differently by React just like **key**. If you add a ref to a HOC, the ref will refer to the outermost container component, not the wrapped component. In this case, you can use Forward Ref API. For example, we can explicitly forward refs to the inner FancyButton component using the React.forwardRef API.

    The below HOC logs all props,

    ```javascript
    function logProps(Component) {
      class LogProps extends React.Component {
        componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
          console.log("old props:", prevProps);
          console.log("new props:", this.props);
        }

        render() {
          const { forwardedRef, ...rest } = this.props;

          // Assign the custom prop "forwardedRef" as a ref
          return <Component ref={forwardedRef} {...rest} />;
        }
      }

      return React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
        return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;
      });
    }
    ```

    Let's use this HOC to log all props that get passed to our “fancy button” component,

    ```javascript
    class FancyButton extends React.Component {
      focus() {
        // ...
      }

      // ...
    }
    export default logProps(FancyButton);
    ```

    Now let's create a ref and pass it to FancyButton component. In this case, you can set focus to button element.

    ```javascript
    import FancyButton from "./FancyButton";

    const ref = React.createRef();
    ref.current.focus();
    <FancyButton label="Click Me" handleClick={handleClick} ref={ref} />;
    ```

445.  ### Is ref argument available for all functions or class components?
    Regular function or class components don’t receive the ref argument, and ref is not available in props either. The second ref argument only exists when you define a component with React.forwardRef call.

446.  ### Why do you need additional care for component libraries while using forward refs?
    When you start using forwardRef in a component library, you should treat it as a breaking change and release a new major version of your library. This is because your library likely has a different behavior such as what refs get assigned to, and what types are exported. These changes can break apps and other libraries that depend on the old behavior.

447.  ### How to create react class components without ES6?

    If you don’t use ES6 then you may need to use the create-react-class module instead. For default props, you need to define getDefaultProps() as a function on the passed object. Whereas for initial state, you have to provide a separate getInitialState method that returns the initial state.

    ```javascript
    var Greeting = createReactClass({
      getDefaultProps: function () {
        return {
          name: "Jhohn",
        };
      },
      getInitialState: function () {
        return { message: this.props.message };
      },
      handleClick: function () {
        console.log(this.state.message);
      },
      render: function () {
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
      },
    });
    ```

    **Note:** If you use createReactClass then auto binding is available for all methods. i.e, You don't need to use `.bind(this)` with in constructor for event handlers.

448.  ### Is it possible to use react without JSX?

    Yes, JSX is not mandatory for using React. Actually it is convenient when you don’t want to set up compilation in your build environment. Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling `React.createElement(component, props, ...children)`.

    For example, let us take a greeting example with JSX,

    ```javascript
    class Greeting extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <div>Hello {this.props.message}</div>;
      }
    }

    ReactDOM.render(
      <Greeting message="World" />,
      document.getElementById("root")
    );
    ```

    You can write the same code without JSX as below,

    ```javascript
    class Greeting extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return React.createElement("div", null, `Hello ${this.props.message}`);
      }
    }

    ReactDOM.render(
      React.createElement(Greeting, { message: "World" }, null),
      document.getElementById("root")
    );
    ```
