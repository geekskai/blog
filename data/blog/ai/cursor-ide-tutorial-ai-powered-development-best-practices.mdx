## Core Features & Capabilities

### Essential AI-Powered Development Tools

**Predictive Code Completion (Tab-Tab)**
Cursor constantly predicts your next code edits. By pressing Tab, you can accept multi-line code completions or edits. The editor "breezes through changes by predicting your next edit" and learns from your context, working across languages and frameworks to significantly speed up coding.

**Natural-Language Editing (Ctrl+K)**
Use **Ctrl+K (Cmd+K)** to write or edit code via plain-English instructions. Select a code block and invoke Ctrl+K, then instruct Cursor to modify it, or press Ctrl+K on an empty space to generate new functions by describing their behavior.

**AI Chat Assistant (Ctrl+L)**
The Chat panel provides a conversational AI assistant that "lives in your sidebar." Open it with **Ctrl+L**, type a question or request, and the model will answer or perform edits. Cursor's assistant can **understand code** (answer questions, explain functions) and **edit code** (make multi-file changes).

**Integrated Development Tools**
- Built-in Git integration for version control
- Advanced debugging with breakpoints and variable watches
- Performance analysis and profiling tools
- **Terminal with AI** – pressing **Ctrl+K in the terminal** generates shell commands from natural language

## Team Collaboration Features

### Collaborative Use Cases with Cursor

Cursor shines in collaborative and team scenarios. Here are key use cases where **AI IDE collaboration** boosts team productivity:

**Shared Code Reviews**
In pull request reviews, team members can leverage Cursor to get AI suggestions on code quality. For example, a reviewer can ask Cursor to "suggest optimizations for this function" or "identify potential bugs in this diff." This helps catch issues and maintain coding standards as part of code review.

**Pair Programming and Knowledge Sharing**
Cursor acts like an AI pair-programmer. Senior developers can set up a `.cursorrules` file or project docs to encapsulate architectural context and coding guidelines. Junior devs then use the assistant to learn the codebase faster. They can query "how does this module work?" or "generate an example usage of this API," turning onboarding into a self-service Q&A session.

**Standardizing Practices**
Teams can agree on `.cursorrules` or code style documents so that Cursor's suggestions align with the project's conventions. Cursor can be configured with project-specific rules (via @CursorRules) so that all developers get consistent AI guidance.

**Multi-Developer Projects**
Cursor handles large codebases well, using "large-scale indexing to get the most out of complex codebases." Whether a team is working on tens of millions of lines of enterprise code or a small microservice, Cursor's AI can traverse the whole project.

**Integrated Analytics and Management**
From an enterprise perspective, Cursor includes team management and analytics tools. Administrators can see how developers use AI in their workflows to measure productivity gains. Features like enforced privacy mode and zero data retention meet enterprise security requirements.

**Remote and Asynchronous Collaboration**
Because Cursor's AI chat can reference and edit code by natural language, remote teams can document decisions directly in chat history. For example, one developer can propose a refactoring via Cursor and another can review the AI-generated diff, all within the chat logs.

### Enterprise Team Management

**SSO Integration**
- SAML 2.0 and OIDC support
- Centralized user access management
- Corporate identity integration

**Privacy Controls**
- Privacy Mode for sensitive code
- Zero data retention options
- SOC 2 compliance certification

**Analytics & Productivity Metrics**
- Developer productivity measurement
- AI usage analytics
- Team performance insights

## Model Selection & Context Management

### Understanding AI Model Options

**Auto-Select vs Manual Selection**
In the **Settings → Models & Pricing**, you can toggle **Auto-select**. When enabled, Cursor "selects the premium model best fit for the immediate task." This is recommended for most users, as it dynamically picks a high-powered model (e.g. Claude 3.5) or a suitable open-source model depending on availability.

**Model Categories**

| Model Type | Best For | Examples |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **Thinking Models** | Step-by-step reasoning, complex logic | Claude Sonnet |
| **Agentic Models** | Tool interactions, autonomous tasks | Claude Instant |
| **Max Mode** | Deep analysis, long-term planning | Premium models only |

**Context Window Management**
Each chat has a token limit for context. Cursor automatically prunes less important conversation history to keep within this limit. However, if a chat gets too long or unfocused, start a new session to avoid loss of context.

**Privacy Mode Considerations**
When Privacy Mode is on, Cursor ensures that no code or prompts are stored by the service. This is important for sensitive projects. Note that in Privacy Mode, Cursor still uses the AI, but all data is discarded after processing.

**Billing and Usage Optimization**
Models are billed by request. Cursor's pricing page explains that each message (including context) counts as one "request" charge. Keep this in mind when using the chat heavily. Auto mode tends to optimize cost vs performance.

## Agent Mode & Ask Mode

### Understanding Chat Modes

**Ask Mode: Read-Only Exploration**
Think of Ask mode as a **read-only search mode**. It's great for exploring a codebase without risk. In Ask mode, the AI cannot write any files or make edits – it only searches and answers questions. Use it to understand unfamiliar code or to plan solutions verbally.

**Agent Mode: Autonomous Development**
This is the **fully autonomous mode**. Agent mode enables the AI to actively navigate and modify your project. It can browse files, run commands, and iteratively plan tasks. When you give it a high-level goal (e.g. "Add error logging to all API endpoints"), the agent will independently explore your codebase, identify relevant files, plan multi-step edits, and execute them.

**Manual Mode: Precise Control**
In Manual mode, Cursor follows your explicit instructions only. It will edit code as you tell it, but it **will not autonomously search or run commands**. This is useful when you know exactly what change you want.

### Best Practices for Mode Selection

**Workflow Recommendations**
- Use **Ask** for learning and planning
- Use **Agent** for implementation
- Use **Manual** for precision edits

**Example Workflow**
1. Chat in Ask mode to outline a solution
2. Switch to Agent to let the AI implement it
3. Use Manual mode for final refinements

## MCP Server Integration

### Understanding Model Context Protocol

**What is MCP?**
MCP is an open protocol (standardized by Anthropic) for connecting AI assistants to external systems. Think of it as a plugin interface: you write or install MCP servers (scripts or services) that Cursor can call. These servers might access databases, internal APIs, documentation, or any data source.

### MCP Integration Examples

**Database Connectivity**
An MCP connector can let Cursor query your SQL/NoSQL databases directly. Instead of manually copying schema or data, Cursor can ask the MCP server to run queries ("Find customers with open invoices").

**Knowledge Base Integration**
You can connect to a knowledge base (e.g. Notion) so Cursor can retrieve design docs, product specs, or meeting notes. Then you can prompt the AI with @MyDesignDoc and it will fetch content via the MCP.

**Git Platform Integration**
MCP can integrate with Git hosting. Cursor could create PRs, open issues, or search code remotely by invoking a GitHub API server.

**Memory and State Management**
A "memory" MCP lets Cursor recall information across sessions, effectively giving it long-term memory. This can be used to store developer preferences or project facts.

### MCP Configuration

**Local MCP Servers (stdio)**
Runs on your machine via command line. Cursor runs the process and communicates with it via standard I/O. This is useful for simple local tools.

**Remote MCP Servers (SSE)**
Runs as a standalone service (e.g. on a cloud server). Cursor connects via an HTTP URL to `/sse` on that service. SSE works cross-machine, so teams can share MCP servers.

**Configuration Example**
You define MCP servers in `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-server"],
      "env": {"API_KEY": "xxx"}
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Network and Connectivity Issues

**HTTP/2 Proxy Problems**
Cursor uses HTTP/2 for streaming AI responses, which may be blocked by corporate proxies. If AI features fail, go to System Settings, search for "HTTP/2," and enable **"Disable HTTP/2"** to force HTTP/1.1. This solves most network issues in restricted environments.

**Corporate Firewall Solutions**
- Disable HTTP/2 in settings
- Configure proxy exceptions
- Work with IT for whitelist additions

### Performance Optimization

**High CPU/RAM Usage Solutions**
On large projects, Cursor can be resource-intensive. If you see slowdowns:

1. **Disable Extensions**: Launch `cursor --disable-extensions` and see if performance improves
2. **Process Explorer**: Use the built-in Process Explorer to pinpoint heavy processes
3. **Close Unused Terminals**: Terminal sessions can consume CPU
4. **Minimal Workspace**: Try launching with minimal configuration

**Extension Management**
Some VS Code extensions may not be optimized for Cursor. Use the Process Explorer to identify which extension process is using lots of CPU, then try updating or disabling it.

### Authentication and Access Issues

**GitHub Login Problems**
If you have trouble connecting to GitHub, use the command palette and run **"Sign Out of GitHub"**, then log back in. This refreshes tokens and can fix sync problems.

**SSH Connection Limitations**
Cursor does not support SSH into Mac/Windows hosts yet. On Windows, if you see "SSH is only supported in Microsoft versions of VS Code," uninstall your current Remote-SSH extension and install v0.113 from the Cursor marketplace.

### Update and History Issues

**Missing Chat History**
If after an update your chat history is empty, it likely cleared data due to low disk space. To avoid this, ensure ample free storage before updating. You can back up important chats by copying them out if needed.

**Subscription and Usage**
If someone just subscribed but their app is still on Free, have them log out and log back in. Usage resets monthly from the signup date, and Pro plan details are on the dashboard.

## Best Practices for AI-Assisted Coding

### Providing Clear Context

**Context is King**
AI models behave like junior developers – they do best when given explicit instructions and background. Always give enough context in prompts. Include relevant code snippets, link to architecture diagrams, or state requirements up front. In Cursor, using `.cursorrules` or attaching docs via @ helps keep context clear.

**Breaking Down Tasks**
Don't ask the AI to "build the entire feature" in one prompt. Instead, decompose tasks logically. Have the AI plan steps: "First, create the API endpoint, then add input validation, then write tests." This matches the human workflow and avoids overwhelming the model.

### Architecture Documentation

**Using .cursorrules Files**
Maintain a `.cursorrules` file (or similar) at project root that outlines your system's architecture and conventions. For example:

```
SYSTEM_CONTEXT:
- You are working on a Django microservice named PaymentService.
- Key components: process_payment(), send_receipt().
- Follow REST API design from docs/api_design.md.

TASKS:
- Check and implement transaction logging.
```

This way, when Cursor starts, it can load that context. Cursor's AI will "parse and understand system architecture" from such docs before editing, improving accuracy.

### Human-in-the-Loop Practices

**Always Review AI Code**
Always review and test AI-generated code. Treat AI suggestions as drafts. Cursor's Agent mode is powerful, but it can sometimes make mistakes or unsafe choices. Keep an eye on security (no secrets in prompts), correctness, and style.

**Iterative Feedback**
Use the chat history to refine the AI's output. If it makes an error, point it out and ask it to correct it. This back-and-forth improves results and educates the AI on your codebase.

**Precise Prompting**
Keep prompts precise. Vague prompts yield vague answers. Instead of "optimize this function", say "Replace the loop with a list comprehension to improve performance." The latter is more concrete.

### Team Collaboration Guidelines

**Context Management**
As you work, manage your chats. If a conversation derails, start fresh. Close out old chats to free up context window. For each new feature or bug, spawn a new chat session.

**Documentation Standards**
When Cursor makes non-trivial changes, it can annotate code. Ask it to add comments explaining major changes or to draft a section of the CHANGELOG. This way the AI's reasoning is preserved.

**Privacy and Compliance**
Verify that no private data (passwords, keys) ever go to the AI. Use environment variables or Cursor's API key management. Use Privacy Mode if required. For regulated environments, check audit logs and only feed necessary data.

**Training and Conventions**
Educate developers on how to prompt effectively. Share examples of good queries (with context) vs. poor ones. Encourage the use of consistent usage patterns. Consistent usage patterns help the AI learn your style.

### Advanced Workflow Optimization

**Version Control Integration**
When asking Cursor to make changes, have your branch setup ready. For instance, create a new feature branch, then ask Cursor to implement a series of commits. After Cursor provides code edits, review and test them before merging.

**Code Review Enhancement**
In Pull Request reviews, team members can trigger Cursor on diff snippets. Even if you don't use it directly in the IDE, you can copy a block of code from GitHub into a chat and ask for feedback. This embeds AI into your existing review workflow.

**Agent Mode Best Practices**
When facing a multi-step task, switch the Chat to **Agent mode** and let Cursor plan and execute. For example, tell it "convert this MVC app to use dependency injection and update all instantiations accordingly." Agent mode will attempt to break that into steps, run commands, and edit files autonomously. Review each step it suggests or applies.

By following these guidelines, teams can turn Cursor into a reliable "AI pair programmer." The key insight from community experience is that *"the secret isn't in the AI's capabilities — it's in how we instruct it."* Use Cursor deliberately, with good context and structure, and it will dramatically accelerate development.
