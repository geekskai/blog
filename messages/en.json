      "faq_how_calculate_answer": "Use the standard board foot formula: Board Feet = (Length × Width × Thickness) ÷ 144, where all dimensions are in inches. Our calculator automatically handles unit conversions and provides instant results with precision control for professional accuracy.",
      "faq_nominal_actual": "What is the difference between nominal and actual lumber dimensions?",
      "faq_nominal_actual_answer": "Nominal dimensions (like 2×4) are traditional lumber names, while actual dimensions (1.5\" × 3.5\" for a 2×4) are the true measurements after planing and drying. Always use actual dimensions for accurate board foot calculations.",
      "faq_cost_estimation": "How do I estimate lumber costs for my construction project?",
      "faq_cost_estimation_answer": "Calculate total board feet needed, multiply by price per board foot, and add waste factor (typically 5-15%). Our calculator includes cost estimation features with wood species pricing and waste calculations.",
      "faq_hardwood_softwood": "Can I use this calculator for both hardwood and softwood projects?",

    "faq": {
      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "description": "Everything you need to know about CCM to HP conversion and engine power calculations",

      "q1": "How accurate is CCM to HP conversion?",
      "a1": "CCM to HP conversion provides estimates based on empirical data and industry averages. Actual horsepower can vary ±15-25% depending on engine tuning, compression ratio, fuel system, and other factors. Our calculator uses proven formulas with different coefficients for 2-stroke vs 4-stroke and naturally aspirated vs turbocharged engines.",

      "q2": "What's the difference between 2-stroke and 4-stroke power output?",
      "a2": "2-stroke engines typically produce more power per cc than 4-stroke engines because they have a power stroke every revolution instead of every two revolutions. Our calculator applies a 1.2-1.4x coefficient for 2-stroke engines and 0.8-1.0x for 4-stroke engines, reflecting real-world power differences.",

      "q3": "How does turbocharging affect CCM to HP conversion?",
      "a3": "Turbocharged engines produce significantly more power from the same displacement. Our calculator applies higher coefficients (1.0-1.4x) for turbocharged engines compared to naturally aspirated engines (0.8-1.2x), typically resulting in 25-40% more estimated horsepower.",

      "q4": "Can I use this for motorcycle, car, and marine engines?",
      "a4": "Yes! Our CCM to HP converter works for all internal combustion engines including motorcycles, cars, boats, ATVs, and racing engines. The calculator accounts for different engine types and configurations commonly found across these applications.",

      "q5": "Why do manufacturers' HP ratings sometimes differ from calculations?",
      "a5": "Manufacturer ratings are measured under specific conditions (SAE, DIN, etc.) and may include factors like altitude, temperature, and measurement standards. Our calculator provides estimates based on displacement and engine type, while actual ratings depend on complete engine design, tuning, and testing conditions.",

      "q6": "What CCM range works best with this calculator?",
      "a6": "Our calculator works accurately for engines from 50cc to 8000cc. For very small engines (under 50cc) or extremely large engines (over 8000cc), results may be less accurate due to different design principles and efficiency factors."

      "q1": "How are random VIN numbers generated?",
      "a1": "Random VIN generators create 17-character vehicle identification numbers following ISO 3779 standards. Our generator includes valid manufacturer codes (WMI), proper check digit calculations, model year encoding, and sequential numbers while ensuring the generated VINs don't correspond to real vehicles.",
      "q2": "Are generated VIN numbers ISO 3779 compliant?",
      "a2": "Yes, our VIN generator creates numbers that follow the ISO 3779 international standard, including proper character restrictions (excluding I, O, Q), valid check digit calculations using the official algorithm, manufacturer identifier compliance, and correct position-based encoding for all 17 characters.",
      "q3": "Can I use generated VINs for commercial purposes?",
      "a3": "Generated VINs are intended for testing, development, and educational purposes only. They should not be used for fraudulent purposes, to represent actual vehicles in commercial transactions, insurance claims, or any activities that could be considered vehicle fraud or misrepresentation.",
      "q4": "What is the VIN check digit and how is it calculated?",
      "a4": "The VIN check digit is located at position 9 and validates the entire VIN using a mathematical algorithm. Each character is assigned a numeric value, multiplied by a weight factor based on its position, and the sum is divided by 11. The remainder determines the check digit (0-9 or X for 10).",
      "q5": "What manufacturers are included in the generator?",
      "a5": "Our generator includes major automotive manufacturers from around the world, including Ford, General Motors, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Kia, and Chrysler. Each manufacturer has authentic World Manufacturer Identifier (WMI) codes from their respective countries.",
      "q6": "Is this random VIN generator free to use?",
      "a6": "Yes! This VIN generator is completely free and doesn't require any registration or app download. It works directly in your browser on any device including desktop, tablet, and mobile. Generate unlimited VIN numbers for testing and educational purposes without any restrictions.",
      "q7": "What export formats are available for batch VIN generation?",
      "a7": "Our tool supports multiple export formats: Plain text (.txt) for simple lists, CSV (.csv) for spreadsheet compatibility with detailed metadata including manufacturer, model year, and structure breakdown, and JSON (.json) for programming integration with full validation information.",
      "q8": "How do I validate VIN numbers in my automotive application?",
      "a8": "To validate VINs, check for exactly 17 characters, verify no I/O/Q letters are used, calculate and verify the check digit at position 9, validate the manufacturer code (positions 1-3), and ensure proper character encoding. Our tool includes validation examples and educational content about VIN validation implementation.",
      "q9": "What makes a VIN number valid or invalid?",
      "a9": "A valid VIN must be exactly 17 characters, use only allowed characters (0-9, A-Z excluding I, O, Q), have a correct check digit calculation, contain a recognized manufacturer identifier, and follow proper position-based encoding rules as defined in the ISO 3779 standard.",
      "q10": "Can I specify manufacturer or model year for generated VINs?",
      "a10": "Yes! Our generator allows you to optionally specify a manufacturer from our database of major automotive companies and select a model year from 2010-2030. You can also let the generator randomly select these parameters for maximum variety in your test data."

          "answer": "A tip screen is a digital interface that appears during payment transactions, typically on tablets or smartphones. It prompts customers to add a gratuity by presenting percentage options (usually 15%, 18%, 20%, 25% or higher) or allowing custom amounts. The tip screen calculates the total automatically and processes the payment including the tip."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "Why are tip screens everywhere now?",
          "answer": "Tip screens have proliferated due to the shift to digital payments, especially accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. They're easier to implement than traditional tip jars, automatically calculate amounts, and can increase tip amounts through psychological design elements. Many businesses adopted them to help staff compensation during economic uncertainty."

        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "What are dark patterns in tip screens?",
          "answer": "Dark patterns in tip screens are manipulative design techniques that pressure customers into tipping more. These include auto-selecting high percentages, hiding \"no tip\" options, using guilt-inducing language, making skip buttons tiny, and displaying tips prominently to create social pressure. Our tool demonstrates these patterns for educational purposes."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "How do tip screens affect tipping behavior?",
          "answer": "Studies show tip screens generally increase both tip frequency and amounts. The suggested percentages often anchor customers to higher amounts than they might leave otherwise. The public nature of the interaction and preset options also reduce the cognitive effort required to calculate tips, making customers more likely to tip."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "Can I use generated tip screens for educational purposes?",

      "items": {
        "how_random": {
          "question": "How random are the generated numbers?",
          "answer": "Our generator uses the Web Crypto API (crypto.getRandomValues()), which provides cryptographically secure random numbers. This means the numbers are truly random and unpredictable, suitable for security-sensitive applications like verification codes and PINs. The randomness quality is significantly higher than Math.random()."
        },
        "no_duplicates": {
          "question": "Can I generate numbers without duplicates?",
          "answer": "Yes! When using the bulk generator, simply uncheck the \"Allow Duplicates\" option. Our algorithm will ensure all generated numbers in the batch are unique. This is perfect for creating unique verification codes or test data sets."
        },
        "is_free": {
          "question": "Is this tool completely free?",
          "answer": "Absolutely! Our 4-digit random number generator is 100% free with no hidden costs, subscriptions, or premium features. You can generate unlimited numbers without any restrictions. No registration or payment is ever required."
        },
        "secure_passwords": {
          "question": "Are the generated numbers secure enough for passwords?",
          "answer": "While our generator uses cryptographically secure randomness, 4-digit numbers (0000-9999) only provide 10,000 possible combinations. This is generally not sufficient for passwords. However, they are perfect for temporary verification codes, PINs, and two-factor authentication where additional security layers exist."
        },
        "more_than_1000": {
          "question": "Can I generate more than 1000 numbers at once?",
          "answer": "Currently, the bulk generator is limited to 1000 numbers per batch to ensure optimal performance. If you need more numbers, you can generate multiple batches and combine them. For very large datasets (10,000+), consider using our API or running multiple generations."
        },
        "store_numbers": {
          "question": "Do you store my generated numbers?",
          "answer": "No, we never store, log, or transmit your generated numbers. All number generation happens entirely in your browser using JavaScript. Your numbers stay on your device and are never sent to our servers. We respect your privacy completely."
        },
        "format_options": {
          "question": "What's the difference between the format options?",
          "answer": "We offer four format options: Plain (1234), Hyphen (12-34), Dot (12.34), and Prefix (#1234). These formats are purely cosmetic and help match different use cases. For example, hyphen format is common for verification codes, while prefix format is useful for ID numbers."
        },
        "exclude_patterns": {
          "question": "Can I exclude sequential or repeated numbers?",
          "answer": "Yes! In the advanced settings, you can enable exclusion rules to prevent sequential numbers (like 1234 or 4321) and repeated digits (like 1111 or 2222). This is useful when you need more \"random-looking\" numbers or want to avoid easily guessable patterns."
        },
        "how_export": {
          "question": "How do I export my generated numbers?",
          "answer": "After generating a batch of numbers, click the Export button. You can choose from three formats: TXT (plain text, one number per line), CSV (spreadsheet-compatible with metadata), or JSON (structured data for programming). The file downloads instantly to your device."

        },
        "range_setting": {
          "question": "How does the range setting work?",
          "answer": "The range setting allows you to specify minimum and maximum values for generation. For example, setting range 1000-5000 will only generate numbers between 1000 and 5000. This is useful when you need numbers within a specific subset of the 0000-9999 range."

    "faq_1_question": "Is it legal to generate random SSN numbers?",
    "faq_1_answer": "Yes, generating random SSN numbers for testing and development purposes is legal when the numbers are clearly fake and used only for software testing, educational research, or development activities. Our generator creates numbers that follow the correct format but do not correspond to real individuals, making them safe for testing purposes.",
    "faq_2_question": "How do random SSN generators work?",
    "faq_2_answer": "Random SSN generators create nine-digit numbers in the XXX-XX-XXXX format following Social Security Administration format rules. Our generator avoids forbidden area numbers (000, 666, 900-999), ensures group numbers are not 00, and serial numbers are not 0000, while randomly generating valid combinations that don't match real SSNs.",
    "faq_3_question": "What is the difference between fake and real SSN numbers?",
    "faq_3_answer": "Fake SSN numbers generated by our tool follow the correct format and validation rules but are randomly created to avoid matching any real person's Social Security Number. They're designed specifically for testing and development purposes, while real SSNs are issued by the Social Security Administration to actual individuals.",
    "faq_4_question": "Can I use generated SSNs for software testing?",
    "faq_4_answer": "Absolutely! Generated SSNs are perfect for software testing, QA processes, database development, form validation testing, and educational purposes. They provide realistic test data that follows proper formatting rules without using real personal information, ensuring compliance with privacy and security best practices.",
    "faq_5_question": "What SSN formats and validation rules does this tool follow?",
    "faq_5_answer": "Our generator follows official SSN formatting rules: XXX-XX-XXXX format, avoids area numbers 000 and 666, excludes the 900-999 range reserved for future use, ensures group numbers are 01-99 (not 00), and serial numbers are 0001-9999 (not 0000). All generated numbers pass standard SSN validation algorithms.",
    "faq_6_question": "Is this random SSN generator free to use?",
    "faq_6_answer": "Yes! This SSN generator is completely free and doesn't require any registration or app download. It works directly in your browser on any device including iPhone, iPad, Android, and desktop computers. Generate unlimited SSN numbers for testing and educational purposes without any restrictions.",
    "faq_7_question": "What export formats are available for batch generation?",
    "faq_7_answer": "Our tool supports multiple export formats for batch SSN generation: Plain text (.txt) for simple lists, CSV (.csv) for spreadsheet compatibility with optional metadata columns, and JSON (.json) for programming and API integration with structured data including validation information.",
    "faq_8_question": "How do I validate SSN numbers in my application?",
    "faq_8_answer": "To validate SSN numbers, check for exactly 9 digits, verify the XXX-XX-XXXX format, ensure area number is not 000, 666, or 900-999, confirm group number is not 00, and verify serial number is not 0000. Our tool includes validation examples and educational content about implementing proper SSN validation in your code.",
    "faq_9_question": "Are the generated SSN numbers truly random?",
    "faq_9_answer": "Yes, our generator uses cryptographically secure random number generation within the constraints of valid SSN formatting rules. Each generated number is independently random and statistically unlikely to be duplicated, even across large batch generations, while maintaining compliance with SSN format standards.",
    "faq_10_question": "Can I contribute to or customize this SSN generator?",
    "faq_10_answer": "This tool is part of our open-source developer toolkit. You can find the source code on our GitHub repository where you can suggest improvements, report issues, or contribute new features. The generator is designed to be educational and transparent about how SSN validation and generation works."
