      "faq_how_calculate_answer": "Use the standard board foot formula: Board Feet = (Length × Width × Thickness) ÷ 144, where all dimensions are in inches. Our calculator automatically handles unit conversions and provides instant results with precision control for professional accuracy.",
      "faq_nominal_actual": "What is the difference between nominal and actual lumber dimensions?",
      "faq_nominal_actual_answer": "Nominal dimensions (like 2×4) are traditional lumber names, while actual dimensions (1.5\" × 3.5\" for a 2×4) are the true measurements after planing and drying. Always use actual dimensions for accurate board foot calculations.",
      "faq_cost_estimation": "How do I estimate lumber costs for my construction project?",
      "faq_cost_estimation_answer": "Calculate total board feet needed, multiply by price per board foot, and add waste factor (typically 5-15%). Our calculator includes cost estimation features with wood species pricing and waste calculations.",
      "faq_hardwood_softwood": "Can I use this calculator for both hardwood and softwood projects?",
