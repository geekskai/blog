## 1. Core SEO Principle for Tool Pages

> **A tool page is not a blog post. It is a problem-solving page.**

Google evaluates tool pages mainly based on:
- Whether the **problem is clearly defined**
- Whether the **tool solves it quickly**
- Whether the **page structure matches user search intent**

---

## 2. The Golden Rule: One Page, One Topic

### ✅ H1 Rule (Mandatory)

- Each page must have **exactly ONE H1**
- H1 defines the **primary keyword**
- Never repeat or rephrase H1 in H2

**Example**
```text
H1 SoundCloud Playlist Downloader
````

❌ Wrong:

```text
H1 SoundCloud Playlist Downloader
H2 SoundCloud Playlist Downloader
```

---

## 3. The Golden Formula for Tool Page Headings

### 🔑 H2 Formula

> **H2 = The exact question users search for**

H2 headings should look like:

* Questions
* Use cases
* Comparisons
* Instructions

**Good H2 examples**

```text
H2 What Is a SoundCloud Playlist Downloader?
H2 How to Download SoundCloud Playlists Online
H2 MP3 vs WAV: Which Format Should You Choose?
```

**Bad H2 examples**

```text
H2 Core Facts
H2 Overview
H2 Introduction
```

These are vague and weak for SEO.
